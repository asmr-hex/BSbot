Contained is a work in progress system for the classification of fabricated 
high energy physics abstracts generated by snarXiv.

Raw Data:
	./raw/arXiv - contains data acquisition script for mining real abstracts from
		arXiv.org.
	./raw/snarXiv - contains data generation script for creating fake abstracts from
		the snarXiv context-free grammar abstract generator.

Pre-Processed Data:
	./preprocessed/scoreFeatures - contains scripts for scoring features in terms of
		their separability between positive and negative class labels.

Project Write-Ups:
	./manuscripts/interim_report - contains the manuscripts for the project.
