Having completed the development and implementation of the feature selection method described above, our initial results show that \emph{Bag-of-Words} features are providing the best separation between classes. This, however, does not imply that we have abandoned hope on syntactic and lexical type features. Instead, we are interested in continuing to test a more diverse set of these types of features. Interestingly though, at this point we have not found any BoW features which are exclusively indicative of a given class. Rather, we have been able to identify a large amount of well partitioned features whose scope within the class they are partitioned to is relatively small. This means that we will most likely be working with a high feature dimension.
