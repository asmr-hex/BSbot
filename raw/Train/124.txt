Energy
Positivity,
Non-Renormalization,
and
Holomorphy
in
Lorentz-Violating
Supersymmetric
Theories
\\
This
paper
shows
that
the
positive-energy
and
non-renormalization
theorems
of
traditional
supersymmetry
survive
the
addition
of
Lorentz
violating
interactions.
The
Lorentz-violating
coupling
constants
in
theories
using
the
construction
of
Berger
and
Kostelecky
must
obey
certain
constraints
in
order
to
preserve
the
positive
energy
theorem.
Seiberg's
holomorphic
arguments
are
used
to
prove
that
the
superpotential
remains
non-renormalized
(perturbatively)
in
the
presence
of
Lorentz-violating
interactions
of
the
Berger-Kostelecky
type.
We
briefly
comment
on
Lorentz-violating
theories
of
the
type
constructed
by
Nibbelink
and
Pospelov
to
note
that
holomorphy
arguments
offer
elegant
proofs
of
many
non-renormalization
results,
some
known
by
other
arguments,
some
new.
