Emergent
Symmetry
on
Black
Hole
Horizons
\\
For
a
stationary
and
axisymmetric
black
hole,
there
is
a
natural
way
to
split
the
fields
into
a
probe
sector
and
a
background
sector.
The
equations
of
motion
for
the
probe
sector
enjoy
a
significantly
enhanced
symmetry
on
the
black
hole
horizon.
The
extended
symmetry
is
conformal
in
four
dimensions,
while
in
higher
dimensions
it
is
much
bigger.
This
puts
conformal
symmetry
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
of
symmetries
that
can
arise
on
black
hole
horizons
in
generic
dimensions.
