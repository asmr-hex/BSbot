Dark
Energy
and
Emergent
Spacetime
\\
A
natural
geometric
framework
of
noncommutative
spacetime
is
symplectic
geometry
rather
than
Riemannian
geometry.
The
Darboux
theorem
in
symplectic
geometry
then
admits
a
novel
form
of
the
equivalence
principle
such
that
the
electromagnetism
in
noncommutative
spacetime
can
be
regarded
as
a
theory
of
gravity.
Remarkably
the
emergent
gravity
reveals
a
noble
picture
about
the
origin
of
spacetime,
dubbed
as
emergent
spacetime,
which
is
radically
different
from
any
previous
physical
theory
all
of
which
describe
what
happens
in
a
given
spacetime.
In
particular,
the
emergent
gravity
naturally
explains
the
dynamical
origin
of
flat
spacetime,
which
is
absent
in
Einstein
gravity:
A
flat
spacetime
is
not
free
gratis
but
a
result
of
Planck
energy
condensation
in
a
vacuum.
This
emergent
spacetime
picture,
if
it
is
correct
anyway,
turns
out
to
be
essential
to
resolve
the
cosmological
constant
problem,
to
understand
the
nature
of
dark
energy
and
to
explain
why
gravity
is
so
weak
compared
to
other
forces.
