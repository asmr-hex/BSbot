Quantum
amplification
effect
in
a
horizon
fluctuations
\\
The
appearance
of
a
few
unevenly-
spaced
bright
flashes
of
light
on
top
of
Hawking
radiation
is
the
sign
of
the
amplification
effect
in
black
hole
horizon
fluctuations.
Previous
studies
on
this
problem
suffer
from
the
lack
of
considering
all
emitted
photons
in
the
theoretical
spectroscopy
of
these
fluctuations.
In
this
paper,
we
include
all
of
the
physical
transition
weights
and
present
a
consistent
intensity
formula.
This
modifies
a
black
hole
radiation
pattern.
