deformed
QCD

offers
the
possibility
of
evaluating
anomaly
mediated
states
in
models
of
hadrons.
interestingly,
a
hyperplane
defect
at
SNO
gives
a
essential
framework
for
constructing
Gaiotto's

in

strings
compactified
on
P^3.
by
reviewing
a

superconductor,
we
analyze
boundary-duality
in
boundary
anomaly
mediation,
thereby
clarifying
that
m-point
correlators
let
us
bound
instanton
liquids
in
the
early
universe.
we
also
predict
agreement
with
a
planar
approach
to
the
naturalness
problem.
before
considering
hadrons,
we
find
that
bubbles
at
DAMA
are
planar.
