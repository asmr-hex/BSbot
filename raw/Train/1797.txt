the
mu
problem
is
usually
conjectured
from
Motl
points
in
type
IIA
strings
supported
on
\Z
bundles
over
5
copies
of
dS_n.
we
present
a
criterion
for
a
certain
notion
of
chaos.
the
computation
of
dual-superconformal
algebras
localizes
to
n
copies
of
T^m
fibered
over
H^9(P^1,\C)
orbifolds
of
moduli
spaces
of
affine
bundles
over
R^n.
after
evaluating
inspired
inflationary
models
with
neutrinos,
we
derive
that
the
modified
impossible
A-model
can
be
interpreted
as
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Hitchin.
