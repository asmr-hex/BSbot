Kinetic
theory
and
evolution
of
cosmological
fluctuations
with
neutrino
number
asymmetry
\\
We
derive
a
kinetic
equation
for
chiral
matter
at
non-zero
chemical
potential
that
governs
the
response
of
the
parity
odd
part
of
the
distribution
function
to
perturbations
of
the
Robertson-Walker
metric.
The
derivation
is
based
on
a
recent
evaluation
of
the
gravitational
polarization
tensor
at
non-zero
chemical
potential.
We
also
provide
the
equations
for
gravity
waves
that
follow
from
the
anisotropic
stress
tensor
describing
the
lepton
asymmetry.
These
equations
can
be
used
to
assess
the
effects
that
a
non-zero
neutrino
chemical
potential
would
have
on
the
evolution
of
cosmological
perturbations.
