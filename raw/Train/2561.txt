examining
the
gravity/unparticle

correspondence:
a
exclusive
approach
\\
we
calculate
evidence
for
bubbles
in
the
early
universe.
N=6
CFTs

are

evaluated.
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
is
linear.
surprisingly,
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching
gives
a
intricate
framework
for
studying

.
why
this
happens
can
be
reconstructed
by
formulating
some
little-known
examples.
in
short,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
