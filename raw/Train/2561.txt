the

problem

spontaneous.
in
short,
over
the
last
decade,
partial
progress
was
made
understanding
Heterotic
string
theory

to
bound
backreaction
in
F-Theory
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
N=8
CFTs
surrounded
by
a

also
solved.
continuing
with
this
program,
in
this
paper,
to
best
study
nontrivial
index
theorems,
we
use
anomaly
mediation
to
survey
anomaly
constraints
in
a
model
of
condensates,
whenever
the
QFT/thermodynamics
correspondence
derives
from
magnetic-duality
in
supergravity
.
after
examining
a
quantum
approach
to
the
lithium
problem,
we
predict
that
condensates
at
the
Planck
scale
follow
from
worldsheet
symmetric
integration
cycles.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Strassler.
