Gravity
from
Breaking
of
Local
Lorentz
Symmetry
\\
We
present
a
model
of
gravity
based
on
spontaneous
Lorentz
symmetry
breaking.
We
start
from
a
model
with
spontaneously
broken
symmetries
for
a
massless
2-tensor
with
a
linear
kinetic
term
and
a
nonderivative
potential,
which
is
shown
to
be
equivalent
to
linearized
general
relativity,
with
the
Nambu-Goldstone
(NG)
bosons
playing
the
role
of
the
gravitons.
We
apply
a
bootstrap
procedure
to
the
model
based
on
the
principle
of
consistent
coupling
to
the
total
energy
energy-momentum
tensor.
Demanding
consistent
application
of
the
bootstrap
to
the
potential
term
severely
restricts
the
form
of
the
latter.
Nevertheless,
suitable
potentials
exists
that
permit
stable
vacua.
It
is
shown
that
the
resulting
model
is
equivalent,
at
low
energy,
to
General
Relativity
in
a
fixed
gauge.
