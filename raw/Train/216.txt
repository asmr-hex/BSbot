The
MHV
lagrangian
vertices
and
the
Parke-Taylor
formula
\\
We
explicitly
calculate
the
vertices
of
the
MHV-rules
lagrangian
in
4-dimensions.
This
proves
that
the
vertices
in
the
lagrangian
obtained
by
a
canonical
transformation
from
light-cone
Yang-Mills
theory
coincide
to
all
order
with
the
Parke-Taylor
formula,
filling
the
gap
originally
left
in
the
lagrangian
derivation
of
the
CSW
rules.
