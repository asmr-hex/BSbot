Vanishing
Chiral
Algebras
and
HÃ¶hn-Stolz
Conjecture
\\
Given
a
two-dimensional
quantum
field
theory
with
(0,2)
supersymmetry,
one
can
construct
a
chiral
(or
vertex)
algebra.
The
chiral
algebra
of
a
(0,2)
supersymmetric
sigma
model
is,
perturbatively,
the
cohomology
of
a
sheaf
of
chiral
differential
operators
on
a
string
K\"ahler
manifold.
However,
it
vanishes
in
some
cases
when
instantons
are
taken
into
account.
I
will
discuss
the
implication
of
this
phenomenon
for
the
H\"ohn-Stolz
conjecture
on
the
Witten
genus.
