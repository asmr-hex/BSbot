The
Coset
Spin-4
Casimir
Operator
and
Its
Three-Point
Functions
with
Scalars
\\
We
find
the
GKO
coset
construction
of
the
dimension
4
Casimir
operator
that
contains
the
quartic
WZW
currents
contracted
with
completely
symmetric
SU(N)
invariant
tensors
of
ranks
4,
3,
and
2.
The
requirements,
that
the
operator
product
expansion
with
the
diagonal
current
is
regular
and
it
should
be
primary
under
the
coset
Virasoro
generator
of
dimension
2,
fix
all
the
coefficients
in
spin-4
current,
up
to
two
unknown
coefficients.
The
operator
product
expansion
of
coset
primary
spin-3
field
with
itself
fixes
them
completely.
We
compute
the
three-point
functions
with
scalars
for
all
values
of
the
't
Hooft
coupling
in
the
large
N
limit.
At
fixed
't
Hooft
coupling,
these
three-point
functions
are
dual
to
that
found
by
Chang
and
Yin
recently
in
the
undeformed
AdS_3
bulk
theory
(higher
spin
gravity
with
matter).
