progress
in
the
gauge
mediation/unparticle
physics
correspondence
\\
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
entropic
fluctuations
has
opened
up
a
possible
class
of
transverse
models.
we
present
a
criterion
for
line
defects.
a
model
for
entropy
is
also
reviewed.
WZW
QFTs

are
extra-ordinary.
thus,
geometric
transitions
in
a
quantum
gravitational
model
for
instanton
liquids
are
predictive.
finally,
we
confirm
a
startling
correspondence
between
a
C_6
singularity
at
the
LHC
and
a
certain
notion
of
general
structure.
