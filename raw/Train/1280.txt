Noninvasive
Measurements
\\
Quantum
weak,
noninvasive
measurements
are
defined
in
the
framework
of
relativity.
Invariance
with
respect
to
reference
frame
transformations
of
the
results
in
different
models
is
discussed.
Surprisingly,
the
bare
results
of
noninvasive
measurements
are
invariant
for
certain
class
of
models,
but
not
the
detection
error.
Consequently,
any
stationary
quantum
realism
based
on
noninvasive
measurements
will
break,
at
least
spontaneously,
relativistic
invariance
and
correspondence
principle
at
zero
temperature.
