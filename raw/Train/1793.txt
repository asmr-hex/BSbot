Fractional
and
semi-local
non-Abelian
Chern-Simons
vortices
\\
In
this
paper
we
study
fractional
as
well
as
semi-local
Chern-Simons
vortices
in
G
=
U(1)
x
SO(2M)
and
G
=
U(1)
x
USp(2M)
theories.
The
master
equations
are
solved
numerically
using
appropriate
Ansatze
for
the
moduli
matrix
field.
In
the
fractional
case
the
vortices
are
solved
in
the
transverse
plane
due
to
the
broken
axial
symmetry
of
the
configurations
(i.e.
they
are
non-rotational
invariant).
It
is
shown
that
unless
the
fractional
vortex-centers
are
all
coincident
(i.e.
local
case)
the
ring-like
flux
structure,
characteristic
of
Chern-Simons
vortices,
will
become
bell-like
fluxes
-
just
as
those
of
the
standard
Yang-Mills
vortices.
The
asymptotic
profile
functions
are
calculated
in
all
cases
and
the
effective
size
is
identified.
