On
the
perturbative
generation
of
the
higher-derivative
Lorentz-breaking
terms
\\
In
this
paper,
we
describe
the
perturbative
generation
of
the
higher-derivative
Lorentz-breaking
terms
for
the
gauge
field,
that
is,
the
Myers-Pospelov
term
and
the
higher-derivative
Carroll-Field-Jackiw
term.
These
terms
are
explicitly
calculated
in
the
one-loop
approximation
and
shown
to
be
finite
and
ambiguous.
