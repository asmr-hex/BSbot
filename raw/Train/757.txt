Cosmic
Bounces
and
Cyclic
Universes
\\
Cosmological
models
involving
a
bounce
from
a
contracting
to
an
expanding
universe
can
address
the
standard
cosmological
puzzles
and
generate
"primordial"
density
perturbations
without
the
need
for
inflation.
Some
such
models,
in
particular
the
ekpyrotic
and
cyclic
models
that
we
focus
on,
fit
rather
naturally
into
string
theory.
We
discuss
a
number
of
topics
related
to
these
models:
the
reasoning
that
leads
to
the
ekpyrotic
phase,
the
predictions
for
upcoming
observations,
the
differences
between
singular
and
non-singular
models
of
the
bounce
as
well
as
the
predictive
and
explanatory
power
offered
by
these
models.
