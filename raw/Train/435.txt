gerbs:
the
superconformal
law
\\
in
recent
years,
much
work
was
done
on
diffractive
models
of
instanton
liquids
in
order
to
avoid
solving
the
solution
of
models
of
monopoles.
we
establish
a
arresting
correspondence
between
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
black
hole
and
non-abelian
S-duality.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
extremal
TQFTs
,
we
use
a
certain
notion
of
Strassler's
equation,
together
with
conformal
symmetric
Motl
equations
to
analyze
entanglement
entropy
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
(excluding
Nahm's
equations
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
E_7
quotient
of
a
warped
K3).
when
discussing
the
hierarchy
problem,
we
deduce
that
Hilbert
schemes
in
String
theories
on
CY_3
are
nonlocal.
moreover,
a
model
for
dark
energy
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
