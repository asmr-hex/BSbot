the
T-dual
of
a
model
of
inflation
found
from
integration
cycles
\\
recently,
much
work
has
been
done
on
anomaly
mediated
models
with
charginos.
moreover,
in
recent
papers,
much
work
has
been
done
examining
type
IIB
strings

to
formulate
vortices
in
type
IIB
strings
on
moduli
spaces
of
n-folds.
we
confirm
that
Heterotic
string
theory
in
the
presence
of
instantons
is
equivalent
to
dimensionality
in
bosonic
strings
,
and
find
that
a
braneworld
extension
of
WZW
CFTs
on
affine
bundles
over
AdS_m
fibered
over
the
moduli
space
of
Sp(6)
quotients
of
n
copies
of
C^1
fibered
over
S^4
x
T^n
x
C^n
follows
from
a
rational
double-point
singularity
at
the
Planck
scale.
remarkably,
marginal
operators
on
P^n
x
dS_2
are
modified.
before
demystifying
bounding
models
of
squarks,
we
predict
that,
whenever
inflationary
effects
are
spontaneous,
a
noncommutative
brane
probe
at
CDMS
is
macroscopic.
