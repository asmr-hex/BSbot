Holographic
Symmetry
Energy
of
the
Nuclear
Matter
\\
We
calculate
the
symmetry
energy
of
the
nuclear
matter
by
using
the
bottom-up
approach,
so
called
hard
wall
model.
To
consider
the
nuclear
matter,
we
introduce
the
isospin
for
u-
and
d-quarks.
We
find
that
in
the
hard
wall
model,
the
symmetry
energy
of
the
nuclear
matter
is
proportional
to
the
square
of
nucleon
density.
We
also
study
the
symmetry
energy
of
the
quark
matter
in
the
deconfining
phase.
Finally,
we
investigate
the
effect
of
the
symmetry
energy
on
the
Hawking-Page
transition
and
show
that
at
the
given
quark
density,
the
Hawking-Page
transition
temperature
decreases
due
to
the
symmetry
energy.
