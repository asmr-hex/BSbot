\\
general
structure
(including
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
Argyres
RS2)
is
phenomenological.
curiously,
among
mathematicians,
much
work
has
been
done
on
QCD
models
for
inflation.
we
therefore
cannot
corroborate
a
result
of
Feynman
that
extending
models
of
spacetime
foam
is
perturbative.
we
discover
that
a
E_6
singularity
must
be
there
as
hinted
at
by
Planck.
Kleinian
singularities
reduce
to
kk
gravitons.
finally,
we
use
nonperturbative
fluctuations
after
reheating
to
examine
(p,q)
branes
wrapping
