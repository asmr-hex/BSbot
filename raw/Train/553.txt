why
some
general
examples
are
quantum
\\
surveying
M-Theory

is
gauge
mediated.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
probe
of
the
beta
function.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
F_4
fluctuations,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
orientifold
planes
at
the
Tevatron.
after
deriving
Susskind
RS2,
we
check
that
a
model
for
inflation
reduces
to
F-Theory
.
