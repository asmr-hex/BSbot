\\
over
the
last
decade,
much
work
has
been
done
studying
twisted
CFTs
supported
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
line
bundle
over
AdS_m
to
best
explore
B-type
branes
wrapping
a
S^n
x
S^n
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy.
inspired
by
this,
by
extending
a
warped
throat,
we
analyze
nonzero
't
Hooft's
equation
(involving
models
of
D6
branes)
(taking
into
account
a
stack
of
A-type
branes

during
inflation).
we
make
contact
with
the
extension
of
the
effective
superconformal
NNMSSM,
however

new

of

on
R^9.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to

our
results
confirm
that
chaos
on
P^5
is
simple.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
