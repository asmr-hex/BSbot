Particle
Motion
with
Ho≈ôava
--
Lifshitz
type
Dispersion
Relations
\\
Using
super
Hamiltonian
formalism,
we
study
the
motion
of
particles
whose
dispersion
relations
are
modified
to
incorporate
Ho\v{r}ava
--
Lifshitz
type
anisotropic
scaling
symmetry.
We
find
the
following
as
consequences
of
this
modified
dispersion
relation:
(i)
The
speed
of
a
charged
particle
under
a
constant
electric
field
grows
without
bound
and
diverges.
(ii)
The
speed
of
a
particle
falling
towards
the
horizon
also
grows
without
bound
and
diverges
as
the
particle
approaches
the
horizon.
(iii)
This
particle
reaches
the
horizon
in
a
finite
coordinate
time,
in
contrast
to
the
standard
case
where
it
requires
infinite
time.
