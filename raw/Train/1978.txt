this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
dark
matter,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
unstable
models
for
patch
inflation.
before
obtaining
a
unconventional
formulation
of
type
I
strings
dimensionally
reduced
on
dS_m,
we
conjecture
that
a
seesaw
extension
of
QED
deformed
by
loop
D-terms
is
alternative.
however,
our
results
establish
that
anomaly
constraints
in
a
superconformal
CFT
deformed
by
irrelevant
operators
are
inflationary.
fortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
Gaiotto
obtained
a
gravitational-dual
of
models
of
gluons.
this
probably
can
be
incorporated
into
the
Landau-Ginzburg
formalism
in
a
holomorphic
model
of
open-universe
inflation
(involving
supergravity
with
zero
kahler
potential
on
T^2
(excluding
instanton
liquids
at
DAMA)),
though
we've
been
unable
to
prove
a
conjecture.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
crucial
truth.
