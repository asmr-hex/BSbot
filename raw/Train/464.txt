Gauge
fixing
in
the
tensor
model
and
emergence
of
local
gauge
symmetries
\\
The
tensor
model
can
be
regarded
as
theory
of
dynamical
fuzzy
spaces,
and
gives
a
way
to
formulate
gravity
on
fuzzy
spaces.
It
has
recently
been
shown
that
the
low-lying
fluctuations
around
the
Gaussian
background
solutions
in
the
tensor
model
agree
correctly
with
the
metric
fluctuations
on
the
flat
spaces
with
general
dimensions
in
the
general
relativity.
This
suggests
that
the
local
gauge
symmetry
(the
symmetry
of
local
translations)
is
also
emergent
around
these
solutions.
To
systematically
study
this
possibility,
I
apply
the
BRS
gauge
fixing
procedure
to
the
tensor
model.
The
ghost
kinetic
term
is
numerically
analyzed,
and
it
has
been
found
that
there
exist
some
massless
trajectories
of
ghost
modes,
which
are
clearly
separated
from
the
other
higher
ghost
modes.
Comparing
with
the
corresponding
BRS
gauge
fixing
in
the
general
relativity,
these
ghost
modes
forming
the
massless
trajectories
in
the
tensor
model
are
shown
to
be
identical
to
the
reparametrization
ghosts
in
the
general
relativity.
