Multiple
M-wave
interaction
with
fluxes
\\
We
present
the
equations
of
motion
for
multiple
M0-brane
(multiple
M-wave
or
mM0)
system
in
general
eleven
dimensional
supergravity
background.
These
are
obtained
in
the
frame
of
superembedding
approach,
but
have
a
rigid
structure:
they
can
be
restored
from
SO(1,1)
x
SO(9)
symmetry
characteristic
for
M0.
BPS
conditions
for
the
1/2
supersymmetric
solution
of
these
equations
have
the
fuzzy
2-sphere
solution
describing
M2-brane.
