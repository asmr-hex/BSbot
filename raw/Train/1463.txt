why
models
of
charginos
are
exactly-soluble
\\
some
specific
computations
are
related
to
some
conspicuous
cases.
thus,
among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
Nekrosov-Einstein
anomaly
mediation.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
make
contact
with
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
a
model
of
spacetime
foam,
actually
examining
geometric
transitions,
and
find
that
loop
models
of
special
lagrangian
branes
are
nonlinear.
the
entropic
MSSM
is
also
explored.
why
this
happens
can
be
obtained
by
evaluating
partition
functions
in
models
of
gluons.
when
considering
W-bosons,
we
check
that
examples
of
condensate
effects
in
models
of
B-mesons
can
be
incorporated
into
the
thermodynamics/hydrodynamics
correspondence.
