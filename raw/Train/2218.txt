Gravity
from
strings:
personal
reminiscence
on
early
developments
\\
I
discuss
the
early
developments
of
string
theory
with
respect
to
its
connection
with
gauge
theory
and
general
relativity
from
my
own
perspective.
The
period
covered
is
mainly
from
1969
to
1974,
during
which
I
became
involved
in
research
on
dual
string
models
as
a
graduate
student.
My
thinking
towards
the
recognition
of
string
theory
as
an
extended
quantum
theory
of
gravity
is
described.
Some
retrospective
remarks
on
my
later
works
related
to
this
subject
are
also
given.
