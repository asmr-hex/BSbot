Microscopic
approach
to
string
gas
cosmology
\\
In
this
contribution
to
the
proceedings
of
the
Conference
on
Modern
Physics
of
Compact
Stars
and
Relativistic
Gravity
in
Yerevan,
Armenia
(September
18-21,
2013),
I
review
recent
work
attempting
to
give
a
fundamental
definition
to
string
evolution
in
a
dynamical,
fully
compact
universe,
and
present
a
sketch
of
how
the
resulting
formalism
can
be
used
for
addressing
questions
of
phenomenological
significance
in
the
field
of
string
gas
cosmology.
