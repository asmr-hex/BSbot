Conformal
Invariance
in
Noncommutative
Geometry
and
Mutually
Interacting
Snyder
Particles
\\
A
system
of
relativistic
Snyder
particles
with
mutual
two-body
interaction
that
lives
in
a
Non-Commutative
Snyder
geometry
is
studied.
The
underlying
symplectic
structure
is
a
coupled,
novel
kind
and
extended
version
of
Snyder
algebra.
In
a
recent
work
by
Casalbuoni
and
Gomis,
Phys.Rev.
D90,
026001
(2014),
a
system
of
interacting
conventional
particles
(in
commutative
spacetime)
was
studied
with
special
emphasis
on
it's
Conformal
Invariance.
Succeed
along
the
same
lines
we
have
shown
that
our
interacting
Snyder
particle
model
is
also
conformally
invariant.
Moreover
the
conformal
Killing
vectors
have
been
constructed.
Our
main
emphasis
is
on
the
Hamiltonian
analysis
of
the
conformal
symmetry
generators.
We
demonstrate
that
the
Lorentz
algebra
remains
undeformed
but
validity
of
the
full
conformal
algebra
requires
further
restrictions.
