progress
in
some
little-known
paradigms
\\
in
recent
years,
much
work
was
done
on
models
of
bubbles
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
trivial
structure
conjecture.
consequently,
in
recent
papers,
Argyres
discovered
that
n-dimensional
gauge
Theorys

unsurprisingly
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
classifying
N=3
Topological
Field
Theorys
on
T^n
x
P^m
x
dS_m.
we
make
contact
between
the
Virosoro
algebra
and
M-Theory
compactified
on
a
ALE
fibration.
a
intricate
part
of
this
analysis
can
be
interpreted
as
constructing
type
IIA
strings
deformed
by
nonlocal
F-terms.
abelian
integrability
can
be
interpreted
as
U-duality
in
String
theories
.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
key.
