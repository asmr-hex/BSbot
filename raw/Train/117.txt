Multi-Stream
Inflation:
Bifurcations
and
Recombinations
in
the
Multiverse
\\
In
this
Letter,
we
briefly
review
the
multi-stream
inflation
scenario,
and
discuss
its
implications
in
the
string
theory
landscape
and
the
inflationary
multiverse.
In
multi-stream
inflation,
the
inflation
trajectory
encounters
bifurcations.
If
these
bifurcations
are
in
the
observable
stage
of
inflation,
then
interesting
observational
effects
can
take
place,
such
as
domain
fences,
non-Gaussianities,
features
and
asymmetries
in
the
CMB.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
bifurcation
takes
place
in
the
eternal
stage
of
inflation,
it
provides
an
alternative
creation
mechanism
of
bubbles
universes
in
eternal
inflation,
as
well
as
a
mechanism
to
locally
terminate
eternal
inflation,
which
reduces
the
measure
of
eternal
inflation.
