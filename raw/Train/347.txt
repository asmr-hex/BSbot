Field
theoretic
description
of
partially
reflective
surfaces
\\
The
issue
of
electric
charges
in
interaction
with
partially
reflective
surfaces
is
addressed
by
means
of
field
theoretic
methods.
It
is
proposed
an
enlarged
Maxwell
lagrangian,
describing
the
electromagnetic
field
in
the
presence
of
a
semitransparent
surface,
and
its
corresponding
photon
propagator
is
computed
exactly.
The
amended
Green
function
reduces
to
the
one
for
a
perfect
conductor
in
the
appropriate
limit,
and
leads
to
the
interaction
between
charges
and
surfaces
with
varying
degrees
of
transparency,
featured
by
a
phenomenological
parameter.
The
interaction
found
via
image
method
is
recovered,
in
the
limiting
case
of
perfect
mirrors,
as
a
testimony
to
the
validity
of
the
model.
