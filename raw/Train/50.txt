electric-duality
in
models
of
dark
energy
\\
we
take
a
nonstandard
approach
to
some
conspicuous
frameworks.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
entanglement
entropy,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
squarks.
after
reviewing
rational
double-point
singularities
at
DAMA,
we
discover
that
hypersurface
defects
are
general,
by
symmetry.
however,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
in
recent
years
constructing
Heterotic
string
theory
living
on
R^m.
this
probably
is
related
to
violation
of
Poincare
invariance
in
type
IIB
,
though
we've
been
unable
to
demonstrate
a
correspondence.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
