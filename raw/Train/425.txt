Cohomology
ring
of
the
BRST
operator
associated
to
the
sum
of
two
pure
spinors
\\
In
the
study
of
the
Type
II
superstring,
it
is
useful
to
consider
the
BRST
complex
associated
to
the
sum
of
two
pure
spinors.
The
cohomology
of
this
complex
is
an
infinite-dimensional
vector
space.
It
is
also
a
finite-dimensional
algebra
over
the
algebra
of
functions
of
a
single
pure
spinor.
In
this
paper
we
study
the
multiplicative
structure.
