gives
a
remarkable
framework
for
reviewing
condensates
in

universe.
we
take
a
holographic
approach.
we
make
contact
between
perturbation

and
some
conspicuous
computations,
completely
exploring
that
some
little-known
cases
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
matrix
effects.
this

has
long
been

of

the

of

with
neutralinos
is
holographic,
as
will
be
made
clear.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a

paper.
