Thermodynamics
of
Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz
black
holes
\\
We
study
black
holes
in
the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
gravity
with
a
parameter
$\lambda$.
For
$1/3
\le
\lambda
&lt;
3$,
the
black
holes
behave
the
Lifshitz
black
holes
with
dynamical
exponent
$0
&lt;
z
\le
4$,
while
for
$\lambda
&gt;
3$,
the
black
holes
behave
the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om
type
black
hole
in
asymptotically
flat
spacetimes.
Hence,
these
all
are
quite
different
from
the
Schwarzschild-AdS
black
hole
of
Einstein
gravity.
The
temperature,
mass,
entropy,
and
heat
capacity
are
derived
for
investigating
thermodynamic
properties
of
these
black
holes.
