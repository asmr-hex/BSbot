investigating
an
orientifold
plane:
a
inconsistent
approach
\\
among
particle
physicists,
Bogoliubov
deduced
that
models
of
squarks
are
the
same
as
the
confinement
problem.
curiously,
in
the
20th
century,
Coleman
evaluated
the
solution
of
a
model
of
instanton
liquids.
we
confirm
a
mysterious
correspondence
between
charges
in
Topological
String
Theory
on
the
NUT
of
dS_n
and
a
topologically
twisted
QFT
supported
on
n
copies
of
S^8.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
a
certain
notion
of
localization.
our
results
illustrate
that
evaluating
models
of
instanton
gas
is
cosmological,
in
the
approximation
that
line
bundles
on
AdS_9
are
anthropic.
however,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
