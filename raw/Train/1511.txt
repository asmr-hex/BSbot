functions
of
matrix-valued
fields
are
not
generally
known
for
massive
renormalized
field
theories.
We
find
the
large-N
limit
of
form
factors
of
the
(1+1)-dimensional
sigma
model
with
SU(N)
X
SU(N)
symmetry.
These
form
factors
give
a
correction
to
the
free-field
approximation
for
the
N=infinity
Wightman
function.
The
method
is
a
combination
of
the
1/N-expansion
of
the
S-matrix
and
Smirnov's
form-factor
axioms.
We
expand
the
renormalized
field
in
terms
of
a
free
massive
Bosonic
field
as
N
goes
to
infinity.
