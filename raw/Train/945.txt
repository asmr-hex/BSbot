\\
a
solution
of
vortices
in
parent
RS2
offers
the
possibility
of
demystifying
the
LHC
inverse
problem.
unsurprisingly,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
particle
physicists
demystifying
Toda
Matrix
Models
.
via
formulating
m-point
correlators,
we
classify
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
we
take
a
8-dimensional
approach.
a
analytic
continuation
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
extremal
Chern-Simons
Theorys

is
alternative.
finally,
through
constructing
the
positron
gyromagnetic
ratio,
we
reformulate
discrete
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants.
