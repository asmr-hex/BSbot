Continuous
Hawking-Page
transitions
in
Einstein-scalar
gravity
\\
We
investigate
continuous
Hawking-Page
transitions
in
Einstein's
gravity
coupled
to
a
scalar
field
with
an
arbitrary
potential
in
the
weak
gravity
limit.
We
show
that
this
is
only
possible
in
a
singular
limit
where
the
black-hole
horizon
marginally
traps
a
curvature
singularity.
Depending
on
the
subleading
terms
in
the
potential,
a
rich
variety
of
continuous
phase
transitions
arise.
Our
examples
include
second
and
higher
order,
including
the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
type.
In
the
case
when
the
scalar
is
dilaton,
the
condition
for
a
continuous
phase
transition
lead
to
(asymptotically)
linear-dilaton
background.
We
obtain
the
scaling
laws
of
thermodynamic
functions,
as
well
as
the
viscosity
coefficients
near
the
transition.
In
the
limit
of
weak
gravitational
interactions,
the
bulk
viscosity
asymptotes
to
a
universal
constant,
independent
of
the
details
of
the
scalar
potential.
As
a
byproduct
of
our
analysis
we
obtain
a
one-parameter
family
of
kink
solutions
in
arbitrary
dimension
d
that
interpolate
between
AdS
near
the
boundary
and
linear-dilaton
background
in
the
deep
interior.
The
continuous
Hawking-Page
transitions
found
here
serve
as
holographic
models
for
normal-to
superfluid
transitions.
