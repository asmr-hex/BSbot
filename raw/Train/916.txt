Discrete
to
continuum
transition
in
multifractal
spacetimes
\\
We
outline
a
field
theory
on
a
multifractal
spacetime.
The
measure
in
the
action
is
characterized
by
a
varying
Hausdorff
dimension
and
logarithmic
oscillations
governed
by
a
fundamental
physical
length.
A
fine
hierarchy
of
length
scales
identifies
different
regimes,
from
a
microscopic
structure
with
discrete
symmetries
to
an
effectively
continuum
spacetime.
Thanks
to
general
arguments
from
fractal
geometry,
this
scenario
explicitly
realizes
two
indirect
or
conjectured
features
of
most
quantum
gravity
models:
a
change
of
effective
spacetime
dimensionality
with
the
probed
scale,
and
the
transition
from
a
fundamentally
discrete
quantum
spacetime
to
the
continuum.
It
also
allows
us
to
probe
ultramicroscopic
scales
where
spectral
methods
based
on
ordinary
geometry
typically
fail.
Consequences
for
noncommutative
field
theories
are
discussed.
