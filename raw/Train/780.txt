A
super
MHV
vertex
expansion
for
N=4
SYM
theory
\\
We
present
a
supersymmetric
generalization
of
the
MHV
vertex
expansion
for
all
tree
amplitudes
in
N=4
SYM
theory.
In
addition
to
the
choice
of
a
reference
spinor,
this
super
MHV
vertex
expansion
also
depends
on
four
reference
Grassmann
parameters.
We
demonstrate
that
a
significant
fraction
of
diagrams
in
the
expansion
vanishes
for
a
judicious
choice
of
these
Grassmann
parameters,
which
simplifies
the
computation
of
amplitudes.
Even
pure-gluon
amplitudes
require
fewer
diagrams
than
in
the
ordinary
MHV
vertex
expansion.
