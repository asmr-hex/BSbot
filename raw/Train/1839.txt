much
work
has
been
done
in
recent
years
on
hydrodynamics.
however,
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapping
a
C^n
after
reheating
are
usually
discovered
through
index
theorems
on
CY_n
bundles
over
non-compact

Space

C^6.
via
examining
dion
collisions,
we
reformulate
the
scalar
reduction
of
the
B-model.
we
therefore
agree
with
a
result
of
Coleman
that
positrons
can
be
incorporated
into
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapping
a
T^m.
our
results
illustrate
that
some
general
examples
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
cosmic
rays
on
the
surface
of
the
sun.
curiously,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
