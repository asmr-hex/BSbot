Perturbations
of
anti-de
Sitter
black
holes
\\
I
review
perturbations
of
black
holes
in
asymptotically
anti-de
Sitter
space.
I
show
how
the
quasi-normal
modes
governing
these
perturbations
can
be
calculated
analytically
and
discuss
the
implications
on
the
hydrodynamics
of
gauge
theory
fluids
per
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence.
I
also
discuss
phase
transitions
of
hairy
black
holes
with
hyperbolic
horizons
and
the
dual
superconductors
emphasizing
the
analytical
calculation
of
their
properties.
