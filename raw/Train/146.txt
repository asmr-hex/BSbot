Vector
Beta
function
\\
We
propose
various
properties
of
renormalization
group
beta
functions
for
vector
operators
in
relativistic
quantum
field
theories.
We
argue
that
they
must
satisfy
compensated
gauge
invariance,
orthogonality
with
respect
to
scalar
beta
functions,
Higgs-like
relation
among
anomalous
dimensions
and
a
gradient
property.
We
further
conjecture
that
non-renormalization
holds
if
and
only
if
the
vector
operator
is
conserved.
The
local
renormalization
group
analysis
guarantees
the
first
three
within
power
counting
renormalization.
We
verify
all
the
conjectures
in
conformal
perturbation
theories
and
holography
in
the
weakly
coupled
gravity
regime.
