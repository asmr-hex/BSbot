Arithmetic
of
N=8
Black
Holes
\\
The
microscopic
formula
for
the
degeneracies
of
1/8
BPS
black
holes
in
type
II
string
theory
compactified
on
a
six
dimensional
torus
can
be
expressed
as
a
sum
of
several
terms.
One
of
the
terms
is
a
function
of
the
Cremmer-Julia
invariant
and
gives
the
leading
contribution
to
the
entropy
in
the
large
charge
limit.
The
other
terms,
which
give
exponentially
subleading
contribution,
depend
not
only
on
the
Cremmer-Julia
invariant,
but
also
on
the
arithmetic
properties
of
the
charges,
and
in
fact
exist
only
when
the
charges
satisfy
special
arithmetic
properties.
We
identify
the
origin
of
these
terms
in
the
macroscopic
formula
for
the
black
hole
entropy,
based
on
quantum
entropy
function,
as
the
contribution
from
non-trivial
saddle
point(s)
in
the
path
integral
of
string
theory
over
the
near
horizon
geometry.
These
saddle
points
exist
only
when
the
charge
vectors
satisfy
the
arithmetic
properties
required
for
the
corresponding
term
in
the
microscopic
formula
to
exist.
Furthermore
the
leading
contribution
from
these
saddle
points
in
the
large
charge
limit
agrees
with
the
leading
asymptotic
behaviour
of
the
corresponding
term
in
the
degeneracy
formula.
