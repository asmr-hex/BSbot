\\
over
the
last
decade,
Gaiotto
predicted
that
the
F_4
extension
of
thermodynamics
can
be
checked
from
a
orbifold
singularity.
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
a
extension
of
vortex
equations
in
M-Theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
symplectic
Taub-NUT
Space,
fortunately
classifying
the
better
solution
of
String
theories
dimensionally
reduced
on
affine
bundles
over
Riemann
surfaces,
and
obtain
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
T^m.
the
calculation
of
equations
of
topologically
twisted
QFTs

localizes
to
R^m.
our
results
prove
that
some
conspicuous
frameworks
are
exactly-soluble.
