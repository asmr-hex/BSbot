little
work
has
been
done
over
the
last
decade
deriving
QED
with
hyperplane
operators
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators.
thus,
some
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
bounding
type
IIA
strings
deformed
by
line
operators.
we
make
contact
with
the
solution
of
models
of
cosmic
rays,
remarkably
reconstructing
the
dion
gyromagnetic
ratio.
regularization
is
also
clarified.
while
exploring
heavy-ions,
we
discover
that,
as
will
be
bounded
shortly,
some
specific
paradigms
can
be
derived
from
a
minimal
approach
to
the
strong
CP
problem.
however,
our
results
demonstrate
that
non-left-right
wavefunctions
are
longitudinal.
