Destruction
of
a
metastable
string
by
particle
collisions
\\
We
calculate
the
probability
of
destruction
of
a
metastable
string
by
collisions
of
the
Goldstone
bosons,
corresponding
to
the
transverse
waves
on
the
string.
We
find
a
general
formula
that
allows
to
determine
the
probability
of
the
string
breakup
by
a
collision
of
arbitrary
number
of
the
bosons.
We
find
that
the
destruction
of
a
metastable
string
takes
place
only
in
collisions
of
even
number
of
the
bosons,
and
we
explicitly
calculate
the
energy
dependence
of
such
process
in
a
two-particle
collision
for
an
arbitrary
relation
between
the
energy
and
the
largest
infrared
scale
in
the
problem,
the
length
of
the
critical
gap
in
the
string.
