On
limitation
of
mass
spectrum
in
non-Hermitian
$\cal
PT$-symmetric
models
with
the
$Î³_5$-dependent
mass
term
\\
The
modified
Dirac
equations
for
the
massive
particles
with
the
replacement
of
the
physical
mass
$m$
with
the
help
of
the
relation
$m\rightarrow
m_1
+
\gamma_5
m_2$
are
investigated.
It
is
shown
that
for
a
free
fermion
theory
with
a
$\gamma_5$
mass
term,
the
finiteness
of
the
mass
spectrum
at
the
value
$
m_{max}=
{m_1}^2/2m_2$
takes
place.
In
this
case
the
region
of
the
unbroken
$\cal
PT$-symmetry
may
be
expressed
by
means
of
the
simple
restriction
of
the
physical
mass
$m\leq
m_{max}$.
Furthermore,
we
have
that
the
areas
of
unbroken
$\cal
PT$-symmetry
$m_1\geq
m_2\geq
0$,
which
guarantees
the
reality
values
of
the
physical
mass
$m$,
consists
of
three
different
parametric
subregions:
i)
$0\leq
m_2
&lt;
m_1/\sqrt{2}$,
\,\,ii)
$m_2=m_1/\sqrt{2}=m_{max},$
\,\,(iii)$m_1/\sqrt{2}&lt;
m_2
\leq
m_1$.
It
is
vary
important,
that
only
the
first
subregion
(i)
defined
mass
values
$m_1,m_2,$
which
correspond
to
the
description
of
traditional
particles
in
the
modified
models,
because
this
area
contain
the
possibility
transform
the
modified
model
to
the
ordinary
Dirac
theory.
The
second
condition
(ii)
is
defined
the
"maximon"
-
the
particle
with
maximal
mass
$m=m_{max}$.
In
the
case
(iii)
we
have
to
do
with
the
unusual
or
"exotic"
particles
for
description
of
which
Hamiltonians
and
equations
of
motion
have
no
a
Hermitian
limit.
The
formulated
criterions
may
be
used
as
a
major
test
in
the
process
of
the
division
of
considered
models
into
ordinary
and
"exotic
fermion
theories".
