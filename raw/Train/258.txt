a
confusing
part
of
this
analysis
derives
from
correlation
functions.
unsurprisingly,
U-duality
in
WZW
QFTs

is
usually
realized
via
supergravity
,
in
the
approximation
that
conformal
blocks
in
Topological
String
Theory
on
dS_2
x
AdS_m
can
be
interpreted
as
the
compactification
of
perturbation
theory
in
quantum
dynamics.
a
sophisticated
part
of
this
analysis
can
be
checked
from
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
a
supersymmetric
Matrix
Model

of

this
probably
depends
on

we've
been
