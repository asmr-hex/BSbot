Gepner-like
models
and
Landau-Ginzburg/sigma-model
correspondence
\\
The
Gepner-like
models
of
$k^{K}$-type
is
considered.
When
$k+2$
is
multiple
of
$K$
the
elliptic
genus
and
the
Euler
characteristic
is
calculated.
Using
free-field
representation
we
relate
these
models
with
$\sigma$-models
on
hypersurfaces
in
the
total
space
of
anticanonical
bundle
over
the
projective
space
$\mathbb{P}^{K-1}$.
