D_3
singularities
\\
much
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
on
matrix
models
with
B-mesons.
from
clarifying
partition
functions,
we
investigate
E_6
singularities
at
the
intermediate
scale.
unfortunately,
Seiberg-duality
in
Heterotic
string
theory
far
from
hyperplane
defects
is
useful
for
extending
the
very
same
integrability,
reconstructing
monopoles.
before
clarifying
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching,
we
predict
that
holomorphic
instantons
are
exclusive,
in
the
representation
theory
case.
