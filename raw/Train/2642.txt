Hidden
singularities
and
closed
timelike
curves
in
a
proposed
dual
for
Lifshitz-Chern-Simons
gauge
theories
\\
We
point
out
that
the
metrics
recently
proposed
by
K.
Balasubramanian
and
J.
McGreevy
\cite{BalaMcGreevyLifshitz}
as
gravitational
duals
to
Lifshitz
Chern-Simons
gauge
theories
contain
both
a
hidden
null
singularity
and
a
region
of
closed
timelike
curves
accessible
to
asymptotic
observers.
Like
the
singularity
in
the
original
Liftshitz
spacetime
given
by
Kachru,
Liu,
and
Mulligan,
this
singularity
does
not
include
large
$\alpha'$
or
$g_s$
corrections
and
hence
appears
to
be
singular
in
string
theory
as
well
as
classically.
