Quasinormal
modes
of
black
holes
in
anti-de
Sitter
space:
a
numerical
study
of
the
eikonal
limit
\\
Using
series
solutions
and
time-domain
evolutions,
we
probe
the
eikonal
limit
of
the
gravitational
and
scalar-field
quasinormal
modes
of
large
black
holes
and
black
branes
in
anti-de
Sitter
backgrounds.
These
results
are
particularly
relevant
for
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence,
since
the
eikonal
regime
is
characterized
by
the
existence
of
long-lived
modes
which
(presumably)
dominate
the
decay
timescale
of
the
perturbations.
We
confirm
all
the
main
qualitative
features
of
these
slowly-damped
modes
as
predicted
by
Festuccia
and
