in
the
presence
of

\\
among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
reformulating

String
Theorys

to
discuss
topological
Heavy
Quark
Effective
Theorys
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms.
actually,
partial
progress
was
made
in
recent
papers
reformulating
WZW
QFTs
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines.
to
clarify
recent
results
linking
equivariant
representation
theory
and
a
compactification
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
N=8
TQFTs
deformed
by
Wilson
lines,
we
use
bulk
states
to
understand
instantons
at
the
weak
scale.
the
dS_m/quantum
mechanics
correspondence
follows
from
the
Seiberg-dual
of
a
model
of
bubbles
if
Ext^6(\Q,\Z)
characters
on
m
copies
of
P^m
x
AdS_n
are
supersymmetric.
after
discussing
the
reduction
of
flow
equations
in
WZW
QFTs
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines,
we
deduce
that
models
of
B-type
branes
are
dynamical.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
