\\
The
gauge
invariant
quark
Green's
function,
defined
with
a
path-ordered
phase
factor
along
a
straight
line,
is
studied
in
two-dimensional
QCD
in
the
large-N_c
limit
by
means
of
an
exact
integrodifferential
equation.
It
is
found
to
be
infrared
finite
with
singularities
represented
by
an
infinite
number
of
threshold
type
branch
points
with
a
power
of
-3/2,
starting
at
positive
mass
squared
values.
The
Green's
function
is
analytically
determined.
