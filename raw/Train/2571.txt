A
Note
on
Holographic
Weyl
Anomaly
and
Entanglement
Entropy
\\
We
develop
a
general
approach
to
simplify
the
derivation
of
the
holographic
Weyl
anomaly.
As
an
application,
we
derive
the
holographic
Weyl
anomaly
from
general
higher
derivative
gravity
in
asymptotically
$AdS_{5}$
and
$AdS_{7}$.
Interestingly,
to
derive
all
the
central
charges
of
4d
and
6d
CFTs,
we
make
no
use
of
equations
of
motion.
Following
Myers'
idea,
we
propose
a
formula
of
holographic
entanglement
entropy
for
higher
derivative
gravity
in
asymptotically
$AdS_5$.
Applying
this
formula,
we
obtain
the
correct
universal
term
of
entanglement
entropy
for
4d
CFTs.
It
turns
out
that
our
formula
is
the
leading
term
of
Dong's
proposal
in
asymptotically
$AdS_5$.
Since
only
the
leading
term
contributes
to
the
universal
log
term,
we
actually
prove
that
Dong's
proposal
yields
the
correct
universal
term
of
entanglement
entropy
for
4d
CFTs.
This
is
a
nontrivial
test
of
Dong's
proposal.
