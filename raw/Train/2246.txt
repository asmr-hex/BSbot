Calculation
of
size
for
bound-state
constituents
\\
Elements
are
given
of
a
calculation
that
identifies
the
size
of
a
proton
in
the
Schroedinger
equation
for
lepton-proton
bound
states,
using
the
renormalization
group
procedure
for
effective
particles
(RGPEP)
in
quantum
field
theory,
executed
only
up
to
the
second
order
of
expansion
in
powers
of
the
coupling
constant.
Already
in
this
crude
approximation,
the
extraction
of
size
of
a
proton
from
bound-state
observables
is
found
to
depend
on
the
lepton
mass,
so
that
the
smaller
the
lepton
mass
the
larger
the
proton
size
extracted
from
the
same
observable
bound-state
energy
splitting.
In
comparison
of
Hydrogen
and
muon-proton
bound-state
dynamics,
the
crude
calculation
suggests
that
the
difference
between
extracted
proton
sizes
in
these
two
cases
can
be
a
few
percent.
Such
values
would
match
the
order
of
magnitude
of
currently
discussed
proton-size
differences
in
leptonic
atoms.
Calculations
using
the
RGPEP
of
higher
order
than
second
are
required
for
a
precise
interpretation
of
the
energy
splittings
in
terms
of
the
proton
size
in
the
Schroedinger
equation.
Such
calculations
should
resolve
the
conceptual
discrepancy
between
two
conditions:
that
the
renormalization
group
scale
required
for
high
accuracy
calculations
based
on
the
Schroedinger
equation
is
much
smaller
than
the
proton
mass
(on
the
order
of
a
root
of
the
product
of
reduced
and
average
masses
of
constituents)
and
that
the
energy
splittings
due
to
the
physical
proton
size
can
be
interpreted
ignoring
corrections
due
to
the
effective
nature
of
constituents
in
the
Schr\"odinger
equation.
