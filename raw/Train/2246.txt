Finite
Temperature
Casimir
Effect
in
Randall-Sundrum
Models
\\
The
finite
temperature
Casimir
effect
for
a
scalar
field
in
the
bulk
region
of
the
two
Randall-Sundrum
models,
RSI
and
RSII,
is
studied.
We
calculate
the
Casimir
energy
and
the
Casimir
force
for
two
parallel
plates
with
separation
$a$
on
the
visible
brane
in
the
RSI
model.
High-temperature
and
low-temperature
cases
are
covered.
Attractiveness
versus
repulsiveness
of
the
temperature
correction
to
the
force
is
discussed
in
the
typical
special
cases
of
Dirichlet-Dirichlet,
Neumann-Neumann,
and
Dirichlet-Neumann
boundary
conditions
at
low
temperature.
The
Abel-Plana
summation
formula
is
made
use
of,
as
this
turns
out
to
be
most
convenient.
Some
comments
are
made
on
the
related
contemporary
literature.
