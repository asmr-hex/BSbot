Borel
summability
and
the
non
perturbative
$1/N$
expansion
of
arbitrary
quartic
tensor
models
\\
We
extend
the
proof
of
Borel
summability
of
melonic
quartic
tensor
models
to
tensor
models
with
arbitrary
quartic
interactions.
This
extension
requires
a
new
version
of
the
loop
vertex
expansion
using
several
species
of
intermediate
fields
and
new
bounds
based
on
Cauchy-Schwarz
inequalities.
The
Borel
summability
is
proven
to
be
uniform
as
the
tensor
size
becomes
large.
Furthermore,
we
show
that
the
$1/N$
expansion
of
any
quartic
tensor
model
can
be
performed
at
the
constructive
level,
that
is
we
show
that
every
cumulant
is
a
sum
of
explicit
terms
up
to
some
order
plus
a
rest
term
which
is
an
analytic
function
in
the
coupling
constant
in
a
cardioid
domain
of
the
complex
plane
and
which
is
suppressed
in
$1/N$.
