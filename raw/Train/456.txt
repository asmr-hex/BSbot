\\
In
this
paper
we
investigate
the
influence
of
an
external
magnetic
field
on
a
flavoured
holographic
gauge
theory
dual
to
the
D3/D5
intersection
at
finite
temperature.
Our
study
shows
that
the
external
magnetic
field
has
a
freezing
effect
on
the
confinement/
deconfinement
phase
transition.
We
construct
the
corresponding
phase
diagram.
We
investigate
some
thermodynamic
quantities
of
the
theory.
A
study
of
the
entropy
reveals
enhanced
relative
jump
of
the
entropy
at
the
"chiral"
phase
transition.
A
study
of
the
magnetization
shows
that
both
the
confined
and
deconfined
phases
exhibit
diamagnetic
response.
The
diamagnetic
response
in
the
deconfined
phase
has
a
stronger
temperature
dependence
reflecting
the
temperature
dependence
of
the
conductivity.
We
study
the
meson
spectrum
of
the
theory
and
analyze
the
stability
of
the
different
phases
looking
at
both
normal
and
quasi-normal
semi-classical
excitations.
For
the
symmetry
breaking
phase
we
analyze
the
corresponding
pseudo-Goldstone
modes
and
prove
that
they
satisfy
non-relativistic
dispersion
relation.
