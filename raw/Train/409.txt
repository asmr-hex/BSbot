Comprehensive
Solution
to
the
Cosmological
Constant,
Zero-Point
Energy,
and
Quantum
Gravity
Problems
\\
We
present
a
solution
to
the
cosmological
constant,
the
zero-point
energy,
and
the
quantum
gravity
problems
within
a
single
comprehensive
framework.
We
show
that
in
quantum
theories
of
gravity
in
which
the
zero-point
energy
density
of
the
gravitational
field
is
well-defined,
the
cosmological
constant
and
zero-point
energy
problems
solve
each
other
by
mutual
cancellation
between
the
cosmological
constant
and
the
matter
and
gravitational
field
zero-point
energy
densities.
Because
of
this
cancellation,
regulation
of
the
matter
field
zero-point
energy
density
is
not
needed,
and
thus
does
not
cause
any
trace
anomaly
to
arise.
We
exhibit
our
results
in
two
theories
of
gravity
that
are
well-defined
quantum-mechanically.
Both
of
these
theories
are
locally
conformal
invariant,
quantum
Einstein
gravity
in
two
dimensions
and
Weyl-tensor-based
quantum
conformal
gravity
in
four
dimensions
(a
fourth-order
derivative
quantum
theory
of
the
type
that
Bender
and
Mannheim
have
recently
shown
to
be
ghost-free
and
unitary).
Central
to
our
approach
is
the
requirement
that
any
and
all
departures
of
the
geometry
from
Minkowski
are
to
be
brought
about
by
quantum
mechanics
alone.
Consequently,
there
have
to
be
no
fundamental
classical
fields,
and
all
mass
scales
have
to
be
generated
by
dynamical
condensates.
In
such
a
situation
the
trace
of
the
matter
field
energy-momentum
tensor
is
zero,
a
constraint
that
obliges
its
cosmological
constant
and
zero-point
contributions
to
cancel
each
other
identically,
no
matter
how
large
they
might
be.
Quantization
of
the
gravitational
field
is
caused
by
its
coupling
to
quantized
matter
fields,
with
the
gravitational
field
not
needing
any
independent
quantization
of
its
own.
With
there
being
no
a
priori
classical
curvature,
one
does
not
have
to
make
it
compatible
with
quantization.
