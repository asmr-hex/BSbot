Z(2)
monopoles
in
SU(n)
Yang-Mills-Higgs
theories
\\
Z(n)
monopoles
are
important
for
the
understanding
of
Goddard-Nuyts-Olive
duality
when
the
scalar
field
is
not
in
the
adjoint
representation.
We
analyze
the
Z(2)
monopole
solutions
in
a
SU(n)
Yang-Mills-Higgs
theory
spontaneously
broken
to
Spin(n)/Z(2)
by
a
scalar
in
the
n
x
n
representation.
We
construct
a
Z(2)
monopole
asymptotic
form
for
each
of
the
weights
of
the
defining
representation
of
the
algebra
dual
to
so(n).
