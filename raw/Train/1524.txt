Born-Infeld-Horava
gravity
\\
We
define
various
Born-Infeld
gravity
theories
in
3+1
dimensions
which
reduce
to
Horava's
model
at
the
quadratic
level
in
small
curvature
expansion.
In
their
exact
forms,
our
actions
provide
z-&gt;(infinity)
extensions
of
Horava's
gravity,
but
when
small
curvature
expansion
is
used,
they
reproduce
finite
z
models,
including
some
half-integer
ones.
