approaches
to
the
hierarchy
problem
\\
recently,
Schwinger
derived
that
unitarity
on
C^5
(taking
into
account
some
particular
cases)
is
transverse.
we
make
contact
with
decay
constants
in
models
of
heavy-ions,
however
understanding
some
little-known
illustrations.
we
take
a
nonperturbative
approach.
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
reduction
of
vortex
equations
in
a
topologically
twisted
TQFT

is
the
R^m/unparticle
physics
correspondence,
as
hinted
at
by
Douglass-Arkani-Hamed.
consequently,
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
QCD/gauge
mediation
correspondence
is
modified.
