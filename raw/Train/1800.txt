Higher
derivative
corrections
in
holographic
Zamolodchikov-Polchinski
theorem
\\
We
study
higher
derivative
corrections
in
holographic
dual
of
Zamolodchikov-Polchinski
theorem
that
states
the
equivalence
between
scale
invariance
and
conformal
invariance
in
unitary
d-dimensional
Poincare
invariant
field
theories.
From
the
dual
holographic
perspective,
we
find
that
a
sufficient
condition
to
show
the
holographic
theorem
is
the
generalized
strict
null
energy
condition
of
the
matter
sector
in
effective
(d+1)-dimensional
gravitational
theory.
The
same
condition
has
appeared
in
the
holographic
dual
of
the
"c-theorem"
and
our
theorem
suggests
a
deep
connection
between
the
two,
which
was
manifested
in
two-dimensional
field
theoretic
proof
of
the
both.
