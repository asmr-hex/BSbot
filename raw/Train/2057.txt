We
study
N=2
supersymmetric
Chern-Simons
Higgs
models
in
$(2+1)$-dimensions
and
the
existence
of
extended
underlying
supersymmetric
quantum
mechanics
algebras.
Our
findings
indicate
that
the
fermionic
zero
modes
quantum
system
in
conjunction
with
the
system
of
zero
modes
corresponding
to
bosonic
fluctuations,
are
related
to
an
N=4
extended
1-dimensional
supersymmetric
algebra
with
central
charge,
a
result
closely
connected
to
the
N=2
spacetime
supersymmetry
of
the
total
system.
We
also
add
soft
supersymmetric
terms
to
the
fermionic
sector
in
order
to
examine
how
this
affects
the
index
of
the
corresponding
Dirac
operator,
with
the
latter
characterizing
the
degeneracy
of
the
solitonic
solutions.
In
addition,
we
analyze
the
impact
of
the
underlying
supersymmetric
quantum
algebras
to
the
zero
mode
bosonic
fluctuations.
This
is
relevant
to
the
quantum
theory
of
self-dual
vortices
and
particularly
for
the
symmetries
of
the
metric
of
the
space
of
vortices
solutions
and
also
for
the
non-zero
mode
states
of
bosonic
fluctuations.
