Unidexterously
Constrained
Worldsheet
Superfields
\\
Super-constrained
superfields
have
provided
for
most
of
the
best-known
and
oft-used
representations
of
supersymmetry.
The
abelian
nature
of
the
Lorentz
symmetry
on
the
worldsheet
turns
out
to
continue
permitting
the
discovery
of
new
representations,
long
after
the
discovery
of
twisted
chiral
superfields.
Just
as
the
latter
were
effectively
used
in
Lagrangian
studies
of
mirror
symmetry,
it
would
seem
hopeful
that
the
new
representations
discussed
herein
may
find
their
own
niche
too.
