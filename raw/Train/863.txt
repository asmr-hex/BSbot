Scalar
Field
theory
in
$Îº$-Minkowski
spacetime
from
twist
\\
Using
the
twist
deformation
of
$U(igl(4,R))$,
the
linear
part
of
the
diffeomorphism,
we
define
a
scalar
function
and
construct
a
free
scalar
field
theory
in
four-dimensional
$\kappa$-Minkowski
spacetime.
The
action
in
momentum
space
turns
out
to
differ
only
in
integration
measure
from
the
commutative
theory.
