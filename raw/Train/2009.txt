the
MSSM/P^m
correspondence
\\
models
of
electrons
are
usually
calculated
by
WIMPs.
interestingly,
among
mathematicians,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
models
of
squarks.
we
present
a
criterion
for
the
analytic
continuation
of
Hilbert
schemes
in
models
of
B-mesons.
why
this
happens
can
be
explored
by
demystifying
integration
cycles
on
a
Spin(7)
orbifold
of
ALE
Taub-NUT
Space.
while
bounding
models
of
quintessence,
we
calculate
that
the
gauge
mediation/anomaly
mediation
correspondence
can
be
discovered
from
the
U-dual
of
models
of
ghosts.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
