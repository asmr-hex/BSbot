Planck
Scale
Effect
in
the
Entropic
Force
Law
\\
In
this
note
we
generalize
the
quantum
uncertainty
relation
proposed
by
Vancea
and
Santos
[7]
in
the
entropic
force
law,
by
introducing
Planck
scale
modifications.
The
latter
is
induced
by
the
Generalized
Uncertainty
Principle.
We
show
that
the
proposed
uncertainty
relation
of
[7],
involving
the
entropic
force
and
the
square
of
particle
position,
gets
modified
from
the
consideration
of
a
minimum
measurable
length,
(which
can
be
the
Planck
length).
