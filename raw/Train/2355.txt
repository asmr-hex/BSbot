Black
branes
dual
to
striped
phases
\\
We
construct
inhomogeneous
charged
black
branes
in
AdS,
holographically
dual
to
a
phase
at
finite
chemical
potential
with
spontaneously
broken
translation
invariance
in
one
direction.
These
are
obtained
numerically,
solving
PDEs
for
the
fully
backreacted
system.
Fixing
the
periodicity
scale,
we
find
a
second
order
phase
transition
to
the
inhomogeneous
phase.
We
comment
on
the
properties
of
the
state
emerging
at
low
temperatures.
For
some
models
we
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
branch
of
striped
solutions
but
no
continuous
phase
transition.
