Wall-crossing
from
supersymmetric
galaxies
\\
We
give
an
elementary
physical
derivation
of
the
Kontsevich-Soibelman
wall
crossing
formula,
valid
for
any
theory
with
a
4d
N=2
supergravity
description.
Our
argument
leads
to
a
slight
generalization
of
the
formula,
which
relates
monodromy
to
the
BPS
spectrum.
