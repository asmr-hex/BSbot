Spin-Statistics
Correlations
in
Various
Noncommutative
Field
Theories
\\
In
this
thesis
we
study
field
theories
written
on
a
particular
model
of
noncommutative
spacetime,
the
Groenewold-Moyal
(GM)
plane.
We
start
with
briefly
reviewing
the
novel
features
of
field
theories
on
GM
plane
e.g.
the
$\ast$-product,
restoration
of
Poincar\'e-Hopf
symmetry
and
twisted
commutation
relations.
We
then
discuss
our
work
on
renormalization
of
field
theories
on
GM
plane.
We
show
that
any
generic
noncommutative
theory
involving
pure
matter
fields
with
polynomial
interactions,
is
a
renormalizable
theory
if
the
analogous
commutative
theory
is
renormalizable.
We
further
show
that
all
such
noncommutative
theories
will
have
same
fixed
points
and
$\beta$-functions
for
the
couplings,
as
that
of
the
analogous
commutative
theory.
The
unique
feature
of
these
field
theories
is
the
twisted
statistics
obeyed
by
the
particles.
Motivated
by
it,
we
look
at
the
possibility
of
twisted
statistics
by
deforming
internal
symmetries
instead
of
spacetime
symmetries.
We
construct
two
different
twisted
theories
which
can
be
viewed
as
internal
symmetry
analogue
of
the
GM
plane
and
dipole
field
theories
which
arise
in
the
low
energy
limit
of
certain
string
configurations.
We
further
study
their
various
properties
like
the
issue
of
causality
and
the
scattering
formalism.
Having
studied
the
mathematical
properties
of
noncommutative
and
twisted
internal
symmetries
we
move
on
to
discuss
their
potential
phenomenological
signatures.
We
first
discuss
the
noncommutative
thermal
correlation
functions
and
show
that
because
of
the
twisted
statistics,
all
correlation
functions
except
two-point
function
get
modified.
Finally
we
discuss
the
modifications
in
Hanbury-Brown
Twiss
(HBT)
correlation
functions
due
to
twisted
statistics
on
GM
plane
and
the
potential
of
observing
signatures
of
noncommutativity
by
doing
a
HBT
correlation
experiment
with
Ultra
High
Energy
Cosmic
Rays
(UHECRs).
