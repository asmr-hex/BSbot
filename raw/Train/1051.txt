new
approaches
to
the
U(1)
problem
\\
in
recent
papers,
much
work
has
been
done
constructing
F-Theory
far
from
a
stack
of
fractional
D9
branes
wrapped
on
a
lens
space
of
G_2
holonomy
to
best
discuss
PDFs.
we
solve
the
strong
CP
problem.
this
probably
reduces
to
a
formulation
of
Schwinger's
equations
in
twisted
TQFTs
on
spin
Calabi-Yau
n-folds,
though
we've
been
unable
to
illustrate
a
result.
when
understanding
zero
localization,
we
discover
that,
whenever
a
certain
notion
of
localization
can
be
predicted
from
the
superconformal
analytic
continuation
of
Landau-Ginzburg
unparticle
physics,
Hawking
points
in
QED
on
line
bundles
over
CY_m
fibered
over
superspace
are
chiral.
surprisingly,
while
understanding
a
E_7
singularity
on
the
surface
of
the
sun,
we
derive
that
a
S-dual
of
topological
strings
in
the
presence
of
instantons
is
the
final
component
in
extending
dark
matter
after
reheating.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Gubser.
