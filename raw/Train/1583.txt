Holographic
entanglement
entropy:
near
horizon
geometry
and
disconnected
regions
\\
We
study
the
finite
term
of
the
holographic
entanglement
entropy
for
the
charged
black
hole
in
AdS(d+2)
and
other
examples
of
black
holes
when
the
spatial
region
in
the
boundary
theory
is
given
by
one
or
two
parallel
strips.
For
one
large
strip
it
scales
like
the
width
of
the
strip.
The
divergent
term
of
its
expansion
as
the
turning
point
of
the
minimal
surface
approaches
the
horizon
is
determined
by
the
near
horizon
geometry.
Examples
involving
a
Lifshitz
scaling
are
also
considered.
For
two
equal
strips
in
the
boundary
we
study
the
transition
of
the
mutual
information
given
by
the
holographic
prescription.
In
the
case
of
the
charged
black
hole,
when
the
width
of
the
strips
becomes
large
this
transition
provides
a
characteristic
finite
distance
depending
on
the
temperature.
