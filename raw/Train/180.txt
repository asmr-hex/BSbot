Cool
horizons
for
entangled
black
holes
\\
General
relativity
contains
solutions
in
which
two
distant
black
holes
are
connected
through
the
interior
via
a
wormhole,
or
Einstein-Rosen
bridge.
These
solutions
can
be
interpreted
as
maximally
entangled
states
of
two
black
holes
that
form
a
complex
EPR
pair.
We
suggest
that
similar
bridges
might
be
present
for
more
general
entangled
states.
