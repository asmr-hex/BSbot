new
approaches
to
the
mu/B_mu
problem
\\
among
mathematicians,
Poincare
calculated
that
the
little
hierarchy
problem
is
chiral.
in
a
way
that
gives
rise
to
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
,
we
use
squarks
to
discuss
B_2
singularities.
m-dimensional

supergravity
deformed
by
BPS
operators
is
also
explored.
vortices
in
Toda
CFTs
on
S^m
are
general.
quite
simply,
nontrivial
path
integrals
can
be
interpreted
as
observables.
actually,
our
results
verify
that
line
defects
are
dynamical.
in
short,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
