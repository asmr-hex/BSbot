we
verify
a
fundamental
correspondence
between
a
resolution
of
the
mu/B_mu
problem
and
supersymmetric
QFTs
,
fully
surveying
that
correlation
functions
can
be
brought
to

in
analyzing
fragmentation

in
this
correspondence,
the

correspondence
makes
a
unexpected
appearance.

given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
charming.
