Tau-functions
for
Quiver
Gauge
Theories
\\
The
prepotentials
for
the
quiver
supersymmetric
gauge
theories
are
defined
as
quasiclassical
tau-functions,
depending
on
two
different
sets
of
variables:
the
parameters
of
the
UV
gauge
theory
or
the
bare
compexified
couplings,
and
the
vacuum
condensates
of
the
theory
in
IR.
The
bare
couplings
are
introduced
as
periods
on
the
UV
base
curve,
and
the
consistency
of
corresponding
gradient
formulas
for
the
tau-functions
is
proven
using
the
Riemann
bilinear
relations.
It
is
shown,
that
dependence
of
generalised
prepotentials
for
the
quiver
gauge
theories
upon
the
bare
couplings
turns
to
coincide
with
the
corresponding
formulas
for
the
derivatives
of
tau-functions
for
the
isomonodromic
deformations.
Computations
for
the
SU(2)
quiver
gauge
theories
with
bi-
and
tri-fundamental
matter
are
performed
explicitly
and
analysed
in
the
context
of
4d/2d
correspondence.
