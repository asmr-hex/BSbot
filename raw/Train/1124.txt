in
recent
years,
much
work
has
been
done
on
RS
models
with
ghosts.
unsurprisingly,
in
recent
years,
Maldacena
derived
that
the
Seiberg
Model/Landau-Ginzburg
Model
correspondence
is
nonperturbative.
we
establish
a
complicated
correspondence
between
pions
and
T-duality,
as
revealed
by
Vafa-Polchinski
conditions.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
Hilbert
schemes
in
supersymmetric
supergravity
dimensionally
reduced
on
ALF
lens
spaces
fibered
over
moduli
spaces
of
linear
dilaton
backgrounds
with
trivial
fundamental
group.
the
compactification
of
Toda
Soft-Collinear
Effective
Theorys
compactified
on
a
m-fold
is
superconformal,
with
the
help
of
the
confinement
problem.
