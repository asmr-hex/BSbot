Conformal
couplings
of
Galileons
to
other
degrees
of
freedom
\\
We
discuss
a
formulation
of
Galileon
actions
in
terms
of
matrix
determinants
in
four
dimensions.
This
approach
allows
one
to
straightforwardly
determine
derivative
couplings
between
Galileons
and
scalar
or
vector
degrees
of
freedom
that
lead
to
equations
of
motion
with
at
most
two
space-time
derivatives.
We
use
this
method
to
easily
build
generalizations
of
Galileon
set-ups
preserving
conformal
symmetry,
finding
explicit
examples
of
couplings
between
Galileons
and
additional
degrees
of
freedom
that
preserve
the
Galileon
conformal
invariance.
We
discuss
various
physical
applications
of
our
method
and
of
our
results.
