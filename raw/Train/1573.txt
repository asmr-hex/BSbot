Towards
finite
field
theory:
the
Taylor-Lagrange
regularization
scheme
\\
We
recall
a
natural
framework
to
deal
with
local
field
theory
in
which
bare
amplitudes
are
completely
finite.
We
first
present
the
main
general
properties
of
this
scheme,
the
so-called
Taylor-Lagrange
regularization
scheme.
We
then
investigate
the
consequences
of
this
scheme
on
the
calculation
of
perturbative
radiative
corrections
to
the
Higgs
mass
within
the
Standard
Model.
Important
consequences
for
the
renormalization
group
equations
are
finally
discussed.
