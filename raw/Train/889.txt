Instantons

\\
Yang-Mills
instantons
on
ALE
gravitational
instantons
were
constructed
by
Kronheimer
and
Nakajima
in
terms
of
matrices
satisfying
algebraic
equations.
These
were
conveniently
organized
into
a
quiver.
We
construct
generic
Yang-Mills
instantons
on
ALF
gravitational
instantons.
Our
data
are
formulated
in
terms
of
matrix-valued
functions
of
a
single
variable,
that
are
in
turn
organized
into
a
bow.
We
introduce
the
general
notion
of
a
bow,
its
representation,
its
associated
data
and
moduli
space
of
solutions.
For
a
judiciously
chosen
bow
the
Nahm
transform
maps
any
bow
solution
to
an
instanton
on
an
ALF
space.
We
demonstrate
that
this
map
respects
all
complex
structures
on
the
moduli
spaces,
so
it
is
likely
to
be
an
isometry,
and
use
this
fact
to
study
the
asymptotics
of
the
moduli
spaces
of
instantons
on
ALF
spaces.
