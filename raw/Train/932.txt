Null
Geodesics
of
Charged
Black
Holes
in
String
Theory
\\
In
this
paper,
we
investigate
the
null
geodesics
of
the
static
charged
black
hole
in
heterotic
string
theory.
A
detailed
analysis
of
the
geodesics
are
done
in
the
Einstein
frame
as
well
as
in
the
string
frame.
In
the
Einstein
frame,
the
geodesics
are
solved
exactly
in
terms
of
the
Jacobi-elliptic
integrals
for
all
possible
energy
levels
and
angular
momentum
of
the
photons.
In
the
string
frame,
the
geodesics
are
presented
for
the
circular
orbits.
As
a
physical
application
of
the
null
geodesics,
we
have
obtained
the
angle
of
deflection
for
the
photons
and
the
quasinormal
modes
of
a
massless
scalar
field
in
the
eikonal
limit.
