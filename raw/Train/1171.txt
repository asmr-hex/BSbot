BPS

Loop
T-dual
to
Spinning
String
in
AdS5xS5
\\
We
use
the
string
sigma
model
action
in
AdS_5
\times
S^5
to
reconstruct
the
open
string
solution
ending
on
the
Wilson
loop
in
S^3\times
R
parametrized
by
a
geometric
angle
in
S^3
and
an
angle
in
flavor
space.
Under
the
interchange
of
the
world
sheet
space
and
time
coordinates
and
the
T-duality
transformation
with
the
radial
inversion,
the
static
open
string
configuration
associated
with
the
BPS
Wilson
loop
with
two
equal
angle
parameters
becomes
a
long
open
spinning
string
configuration
which
is
produced
by
taking
the
equal
limit
of
two
frequencies
for
the
folded
spinning
closed
string
with
two
spins
in
AdS_5
\times
S^5.
