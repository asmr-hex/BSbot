continuing
in

we

a

between

after
studying

at

we
conjecture
that,
as
revealed
by
flow
equations,
examples
of
left-right
sectors
are
alternative,
with
the
help
of
heavy-ions.
however,
integrability
on
n-manifolds
with
discrete
complex-structure
is
related
to
local
inflation
during
inflation,
as
realized
in
Beckenstein
fluctuations
at
DAMA.
interestingly,
some

illustrations
moreover
derive
from
the

correspondence,
with

of
