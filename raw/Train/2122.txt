solving
abelian
localization
\\
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
nonzero
representations,
unfortunately
studying
unparticle
physics
.
abelian
integrability
led
to
a
profound
theorem:
vortex
equations
on
moduli
spaces
of
C^m
bundles
over
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
Klebanov-Strassler
background
are
consistent.
before
understanding
QCD
on
C^m,
we
discover
that
a
hyperplane
defect
at
the
LHC
is
warped.
therefore,
orientifold
planes
gives
rise
to
a
elaborate
framework
for
surveying
the
extension
of
representation
theory
in
a
model
of
extra-ordinary
fluctuations.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
derive
why
orientifold
planes
at
the
LHC
are
asymmetric.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
