The
Quantum
Viscosity
Bound
In
Lovelock
Gravity
\\
Based
on
the
finite-temperature
AdS/CFT
correspondence,
we
calculate
the
ratio
of
shear
viscosity
to
entropy
density
in
any
Lovelock
theories
to
any
order.
Our
result
shows
that
any
Lovelock
correction
terms
except
the
Gauss-Bonnet
term
have
no
contribution
to
the
value
of
$\eta/s$.
This
result
is
consistent
with
that
of
Brustein
and
Medved's
prediction.
