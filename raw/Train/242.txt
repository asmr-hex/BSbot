On
the
Renormalization
of
the
Complex
Scalar
Free
Field
Theory
\\
Polar
coordinates
are
used
for
the
complex
scalar
free
field
in
D=4
dimensions.
The
resulting
non
renormalizable
theory
is
healed
by
using
a
recently
proposed
symmetric
subtraction
procedure.
The
existence
of
the
coordinates
transformation
is
proved
by
construction.
