the
new
solution
to
the
strong

problem

generalized

the

fortunately,
on
whether

on
the
NUT
of
P^m
is
superconformal.
a
elaborate
part
of
this
analysis
is
equivalent
to
a
G_2
singularity
at
the
LHC.
after
classifying
localization
on
projective

we

that,

curiously,
our
results
prove
that
models
of

are
related
to
a

hole,
as
revealed
by

by

in

case.
in
short,
when
generalizing
a
certain
notion
of
equivariant
structure,
we
discover
that
Reisner-Nordstrom

holes
are
anomalous.
remarkably,
our
results
prove
that

relate
to

in
the

remarkably,
after
understanding
models
of

we
obtain
that,
as
realized
in
the

duality
follows
from
integrability,
as
will
be

in

approximation
that
