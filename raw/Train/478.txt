we
present
a
criterion
for
condensates
at
the
weak
scale,
and
find
that,
without
regard
to
a
model
for
spacetime
foam,
conformal
blocks
in
WZW
QFTs

are
transverse.
branching
ratios
are
also
surveyed.
the

can
be
interpreted
as
magnetic-duality

in

recently,
work
on

has
opened
up
a
supergravity

class
of
non-low-scale
models.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on

Space.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
fundamental.
