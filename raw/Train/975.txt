Gauge/Gravity
Duality
and
Some
Applications
\\
We
discuss
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence
in
which
space-time
emerges
from
an
interacting
theory
of
D-branes
and
open
strings.
These
ideas
have
a
historical
continuity
with
QCD
which
is
an
interacting
theory
of
quarks
and
gluons.
In
particular
we
review
the
classic
case
of
D3
branes
and
the
non-conformal
D1
brane
system.
We
outline
by
some
illustrative
examples
the
calculations
that
are
enabled
in
a
strongly
coupled
gauge
theory
by
correspondence
with
dynamical
horizons
in
semi-classical
gravity
in
one
higher
dimension.
We
also
discuss
implications
of
the
gauge-fluid/gravity
correspondence
for
the
information
paradox
of
black
hole
physics.
