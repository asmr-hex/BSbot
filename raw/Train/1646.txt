Electrified
branes
\\
A
geometrical
form
of
the
supersymmetry
conditions
for
D-branes
on
arbitrary
type
II
supersymmetric
backgrounds
is
derived,
as
well
as
the
associated
BPS
bounds.
The
treatment
is
general
and
allows
to
consider,
for
instance,
non-static
configurations
or
D-branes
supporting
a
non-vanishing
electric
flux,
hence
completing
previous
partial
results.
In
particular,
our
discussion
clarifies
how
the
notion
of
calibration
can
be
extended
in
order
to
be
applicable
to
the
most
general
supersymmetric
configurations.
As
an
exemplifying
preliminary
step,
the
procedure
followed
is
first
applied
to
fundamental
strings.
