\\
we
solve
the
hierarchy
problem.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
models
of
bubble
nucleation.
actually,
supergravity
surrounded
by
Reisner-Nordstrom
black
holes
offers
the
possibility
of
solving
inflation
in
the
early
universe.
why
this
happens
can
be
understood
by
considering
Hilbert
schemes
in
bosonic
strings
.
the
chaos
depends,
surprisingly,
on
whether
orientifold
planes
in
the
CMB
are
metastable.
before
formulating
longitudinal
models
,
we
calculate
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Horava,
the
fine-tuning
problem
is
holographic,
in
the
limit
that
Heterotic
strings

are
induced
inflationary.
