Massive

from

\\
We
explore
the
small-temperature
regime
in
the
deconfined
phase
of
massive
fundamental
matter
at
finite
baryon
number
density
coupled
to
the
3+1
dimensional
N=4
SYM
theory.
In
this
setting,
we
can
demonstrate
a
new
type
of
non-trivial
temperature-independent
scaling
solutions
for
the
probe
brane
embeddings.
Focusing
mostly
on
matter
supported
in
2+1
dimensions,
the
thermodynamics
indicate
that
there
is
a
quantum
liquid
with
interesting
density-dependent
low-temperature
physics.
We
also
comment
about
3+1
and
1+1
dimensional
systems,
where
we
further
find
for
example
a
new
thermodynamic
instability.
