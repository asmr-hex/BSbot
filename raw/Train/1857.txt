Linear
Spinor
Fields
in
Relativistic
Dynamics
\\
Linear
spinor
fields
are
a
generalization
of
the
Dirac
field
that
have
transparent
cluster
decomposability
properties
needed
for
classical
correspondence
of
relativistic
quantum
systems.
The
algebra
of
these
fields
directly
incorporate
gravitation
within
a
group
that
unifies
the
dynamics
of
the
same
number
of
additional
hermitian
carriers
of
quantum
numbers
as
there
are
gauge
fields
in
SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1).
They
also
provide
a
mechanism
for
the
dynamic
mixing
of
massless
neutrinos
using
a
"transverse
mass"
conjugate
to
the
affine
parameter
labeling
translations
along
its
light-like
trajectory,
consistent
with
those
in
the
standard
model.
