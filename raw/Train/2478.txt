On
some
models
of
geometric
noncommutative
general
relativity
\\
Using
Fedosov
theory
of
deformation
quantization
of
endomorphism
bundle
we
construct
several
models
of
pure
geometric,
deformed
vacuum
gravity,
corresponding
to
arbitrary
symplectic
noncommutativity
tensor.
Deformations
of
Einstein-Hilbert
and
Palatini
actions
are
investigated.
Coordinate
covariant
field
equations
are
derived
up
to
the
second
order
of
the
deformation
parameter.
For
some
models
they
are
solved
and
explicit
corrections
to
an
arbitrary
Ricci-flat
metric
are
pointed
out.
The
relation
to
the
theory
of
Seiberg-Witten
map
is
also
studied
and
the
correspondence
to
the
spacetime
noncommutativity
described
by
Fedosov
*-product
of
functions
is
explained.
