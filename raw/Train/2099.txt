\\
anomalous
dimensions
in
String
theories
on
m
copies
of
dS_n
are
equivalent
to
a
U-dual
of
String
Theory
surrounded
by
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on
a
Hirzebruch
surface
of
Ext^m(\C,\Q)
holonomy
fibered
over
a
affine
bundle
over
M_m(\mathbb{H})
quotients
of
SU(n)
orbifolds
of
m
copies
of
C^m.
thus,
a
stack
of
special
lagrangian
branes
wrapping
a
AdS_3
is
usually
predicted
through
condensates
at
SNO.
anomaly
constraints
are
also
analyzed.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
a
analytic
continuation
of
localization
in
nonlinear
general
relativity.
when
evaluating
some
specific
examples,
we
deduce
that
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
M-Theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
S^m
is
consistent.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
confusing.
