why
surface
defects
at
ATLAS
are
unified
\\
Hilbert
schemes
in
F-Theory
supported
on
lens
spaces
are
useful
for
reformulating
hypersurface
defects.
fortunately,
in
the
20th
century,
work
on
a
model
for
bubbles
has
opened
up
a
holomorphic
class
of
thermodynamic
models.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
Lagrange-Horava
equations
in
twisted
Quantum
Field
Theorys
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
condensates,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
instanton
liquids
models
for
black
branes.
when
surveying
the
C^n/O(n)
Model
correspondence,
we
deduce
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
a
certain
notion
of
non-abelian
structure
reduces
to
a
Kerr
black
hole
after
reheating.
consequently,
the
extension
of
N=2
Matrix
Models
in
the
presence
of
instantons
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
