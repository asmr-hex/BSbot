Enhanced
CMBR
non-Gaussianities
from
Lorentz
violation
\\
We
study
the
effects
of
Lorentz
symmetry
violation
on
the
scalar
CMBR
bispectrum.
Our
quantitative
results
show
that
there
can
be
enhancements
in
the
bispectrum
for
specific
configurations
in
momentum
space,
when
the
modified
dispersion
relations
resulting
from
the
symmetry
breaking
violate
the
adiabatic
condition
for
a
short
period
of
time
in
the
early
Universe.
The
kind
of
configurations
that
are
enhanced
and
the
pattern
of
oscillations
in
wavenumbers
that
generically
appear
in
the
bispectrum
strictly
depend
on
the
form
of
the
modified
dispersion
relation,
and
therefore
on
the
pattern
of
Lorentz
violation.
These
effects
are
found
to
be
distinct
from
those
that
appear
when
modelling
very
high-energy
(transplanckian)
physics
via
modified
boundary
conditions
(modified
vacuum).
In
fact,
under
certain
conditions,
the
enhancements
are
even
stronger,
and
possibly
open
a
door
to
the
experimental
study
of
Lorentz
violation
through
these
phenomena.
