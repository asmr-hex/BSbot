unfortunately,
among
particle
physicists,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
flavor
models

to
explain
recent
results
linking
NS5
instantons
and
instantons.
we
also
derive
agreement
with
some
little-known
examples.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
C_n
singularities
in
the
CMB.
our
results
show
that
instantons
at
ATLAS
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
instantons
at
SNO.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
