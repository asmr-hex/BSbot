A
Hilbert
space
setting
for
interacting
higher
spin
fields
and
the
Higgs
issue
\\
Wigner's
famous
1939
classification
of
positive
energy
representations,
combined
with
the
more
recent
modular
localization
principle,
has
led
to
a
significant
conceptual
and
computational
extension
of
renormalized
perturbation
theory
to
interactions
involving
fields
of
higher
spin.
Traditionally
the
clash
between
pointlike
localization
and
the
the
Hilbert
space
was
resolved
by
passing
to
a
Krein
space
setting
which
resulted
in
the
well-known
BRST
gauge
formulation.
Recently
it
turned
out
that
maintaining
a
Hilbert
space
formulation
for
interacting
higher
spin
fields
requires
a
weakening
of
localization
from
point-
to
string-like
fields
for
which
the
d=s+1
short
distance
scaling
dimension
for
integer
spins
is
reduced
to
d=1
and
and
renormalizable
couplings
in
the
sense
of
power-counting
exist
for
any
spin.
This
new
setting
leads
to
a
significant
conceptual
change
of
the
relation
of
massless
couplings
with
their
massless
counterpart.
Whereas
e.g.
the
renormalizable
interactions
of
s=1
massive
vectormesons
with
s&lt;1
matter
falls
within
the
standard
field-particle
setting,
their
zero
mass
limits
lead
to
much
less
understood
phenomena
as
"infraparticles"
and
gluon/quark
confinement.
It
is
not
surprising
that
such
drastic
conceptual
changes
in
the
area
of
gauge
theories
also
lead
to
a
radical
change
concerning
the
Higgs
issue.
