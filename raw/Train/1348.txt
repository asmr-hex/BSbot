A
Renormalisable
Cosmodynamic
Model
\\
The
fermionic
gyromagnetic
ratio
g=
2
of
the
Kerr-Newman
spacetime
cannot
be
a
computational
"coincidence".
This
naturally
immerges
in
a
four
dimensional
generally
covariant
modified
Yang-Mills
action,
which
depends
on
the
lorentzian
complex
structure
of
spacetime
and
not
its
metric.
This
metric
independence
makes
the
model
renormalizable.
It
is
a
counter
example
to
the
general
belief
that
"string
theory
is
the
only
selfconsistent
quantum
model
which
includes
gravity".
The
other
properties
of
the
model
are
phenomenologically
very
interesting
too.
The
modified
Yang-Mills
action
generates
a
linear
potential,
instead
of
the
Coulomb-like
(1/r)
potential
of
the
ordinary
action.
Therefore
the
Yang-Mills
excitations
must
be
perturbatively
confined.
This
separates
the
solutions
of
the
model
into
the
vacuum
bosonic
sector
of
the
periodic
configurations,
the
"leptonic"
sector
with
fermionic
solitons
and
their
gauge
field
excitations,
the
"hadronic"
sector.
Simple
integrability
conditions
of
the
pure
geometric
equations
imply
a
limited
number
of
"leptonic"
and
"hadronic"
families.
The
geometric
surfaces
are
generally
inside
the
SU(2,2)
classical
domain.
Soliton
spin
and
gravity
measure
how
much
the
surface
penetrates
inside
the
classical
domain.
The
i0
point
of
infinity
breaks
the
SU(2,2)
symmetry
down
to
the
Poincare
and
dilation
groups.
A
scaling
breaking
mechanism
is
presented.
Hence
the
pure
geometric
modes
and
asymptotically
flat
solitons
of
the
model
must
belong
to
representations
of
the
Poincare
group.
The
metrics
compatible
to
the
lorentzian
complex
structure
are
induced
by
a
Kaehler
metric
and
the
spacetime
is
a
totally
real
lagrangian
submanifold
of
a
Kaehler
manifold.
This
opens
up
the
possibility
to
use
the
geometric
quantization
directly
to
the
solitonic
surfaces
of
the
model,
considering
their
corresponding
Kaehler
symplectic
manifold
as
their
phase
space.
