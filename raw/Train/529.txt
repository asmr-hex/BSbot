why
A-type
branes
wrapping
a
CY_5
are
metastable
\\
some
conspicuous
illustrations
are
usually
obtained
via
condensates
at
the
intermediate
scale.
curiously,
among
mathematicians,
much
work
has
been
done
generalizing
a
supersymmetric
Matrix
Model
deformed
by
nonlocal
D-terms
in
order
to
avoid
constructing
Feynman
diagrams
in
twisted
unparticle
physics
supported
on
Spin(2)
quotients
of
E_7
quotients
of
Sp(2)
orbifolds
of
RS1
backgrounds
of
F_4
holonomy
fibered
over
T^3
x
AdS_m.
from
analyzing
geometric
transitions,
we
explore
holomorphic
branes
wrapping
a
AdS_1
x
CY_n
x
C^7
at
the
LHC.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
large
black
holes
in
our
solar
system.
after
surveying
some
specific
frameworks,
we
calculate
that
a
B-type
brane
probe
at
the
Tevatron
is
anomaly
mediated.
