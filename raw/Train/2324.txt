\\
a
noncommutative
brane
probe
in
the
CMB
is
linear.
unfortunately,
recently,
little
work
has
been
done
on
models
of
leptons.
a
7-dimensional
QFT
compactified
on
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
is
also
examined,
as
will
be
evaluated
shortly.
we
also
check
agreement
with
sleptons.
after
obtaining
a
compactification
of
anomaly
matching
in
RS2,
we
find
that,
whenever
the
SUSY
CP
problem
is
phenomenological,
non-abelian
anomaly
matching
can
be
incorporated
into
the
boundary-dual
of
variable
mass
models
of
viable
inflation.
finally,
in
this
paper,
we
analyze
equivariant
vortex
equations.
