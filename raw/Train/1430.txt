W-algebras
and
surface
operators
in
N=2
gauge
theories
\\
A
general
class
of
W-algebras
can
be
constructed
from
the
affine
sl(N)
algebra
by
(quantum)
Drinfeld-Sokolov
reduction
and
are
classified
by
partitions
of
N.
Surface
operators
in
an
N=2
SU(N)
4d
gauge
theory
are
also
classified
by
partitions
of
N.
We
argue
that
instanton
partition
functions
of
N=2
gauge
theories
in
the
presence
of
a
surface
operator
can
also
be
computed
from
the
corresponding
W-algebra.
We
test
this
proposal
by
analysing
the
Polyakov-Bershadsky
W_3^(2)
algebra
obtaining
results
that
are
in
agreement
with
the
known
partition
functions
for
SU(3)
gauge
theories
with
a
so
called
simple
surface
operator.
As
a
byproduct,
our
proposal
implies
relations
between
the
W_3^(2)
and
W_3
algebras.
