Euler-Heisenberg
lagrangian
through
Krein
regularization
\\
The
Euler-Heisenberg
effective
action
at
the
one-loop
for
a
constant
electromagnetic
field
is
derived
in
Krein
space
quantization
with
Ford's
idea
of
uctuated
light-cone.
In
this
work
we
present
a
perturbative,
but
convergent
solution
of
the
effective
action.
Without
using
any
renormalization
procedure,
the
result
coincides
with
the
famous
renormalized
Euler-Heisenberg
action.
