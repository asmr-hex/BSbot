A
quantum
isomonodromy
equation
and
its
application
to
N=2
SU(N)
gauge
theories
\\
We
give
an
explicit
differential
equation
which
is
expected
to
determine
the
instanton
partition
function
in
the
presence
of
the
full
surface
operator
in
N=2
SU(N)
gauge
theory.
The
differential
equation
arises
as
a
quantization
of
a
certain
Hamiltonian
system
of
isomonodromy
type
discovered
by
Fuji,
Suzuki
and
Tsuda.
