Partition
Functions
on
the
Euclidean
Plane
with
Compact
Boundaries
in
Conformal
and
Non-Conformal
Theories
\\
In
this
letter
we
calculate
the
exact
partition
function
for
free
bosons
on
the
plane
with
lacunae.
First
the
partition
function
for
a
plane
with
two
spherical
holes
is
calculated
by
matching
exactly
for
the
infinite
set
of
Wilson
coefficients
in
an
effective
world
line
theory
and
then
performing
the
ensuing
Gaussian
integration.
The
partition
is
then
re-calculated
using
conformal
field
theory
techniques,
and
the
equality
of
the
two
results
is
made
manifest.
It
is
then
demonstrated
that
there
is
an
exact
correspondence
between
the
Wilson
coefficients
(susceptabilities)
in
the
effective
field
theory
and
the
weights
of
the
individual
excitations
of
the
closed
string
coherent
state
on
the
boundary.
We
calculate
the
partition
function
for
the
case
of
three
holes
where
CFT
techniques
necessitate
a
closed
form
for
the
map
from
the
corresponding
closed
string
pants
diagrams.
Finally,
it
is
shown
that
the
Wilson
coefficients
for
the
case
of
quartic
and
higher
order
kernels,
where
standard
CFT
techniques
are
no
longer
applicable,
can
also
be
completely
determined.
These
techniques
can
also
be
applied
to
the
case
of
non-trivial
central
charges.
