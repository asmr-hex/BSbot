the
cosmological
formulation
of
String
Theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
C^9
unsurprisingly
is
related
to
a
certain
notion
of
chaos.
thus,
much
work
has
been
done
recently
on
the
A-model.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
instanton
liquids,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
localization
on
R^m.
the
representation
theory
depends,
however,
on
whether
topologically
twisted
TQFTs
far
from
a
stack
of
D8
branes
wrapping
a
P^6
are
linear.
while
generalizing
the
solution
of
type
I
strings
deformed
by
BPS
operators,
we
predict
that
entropy
at
the
Planck
scale
is
holographic.
