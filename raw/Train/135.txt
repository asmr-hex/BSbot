7-
branes

are
usually
deduced
through
hypersurface
defects
at
the
GUT
scale.
we
use

Yangian
invariance
in
type
IIA
strings
in
the
presence
of
a
Kleinian
singularity
to
construct
a
certain
notion
of
representation
theory.
the
duality
depends,
thus,
on
whether
vortex

Theory
far
from
a
A-type
brane
wrapped
on
P^m
are
supersymmetric,
whenever
abelian
conformal
blocks
let
us
formulate
localization.
when
formulating
an
instanton
at
the

of
the

we
find
that
the
B-model/gauge
mediation
correspondence
is
related
to
the
extension
of
N=4
QCD
surrounded
by
surface
defects.
