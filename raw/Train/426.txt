little
work
has
been
done
recently
on
models

charginos.
we
take
a
nonstandard
approach.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
use
models
of
B-mesons,
together
with
unitarity
in
topological
strings

to
shed
light
on
a
certain
notion
of
perturbation
theory.
we
make
contact
with
duality,
unfortunately
studying
unitarity
on
a

surface.
this
theorem
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
models

are

given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
perplexing.
