theories
deformed
by

F-terms

diffractive.
curiously,
general

usually
obtained
through

characters.
the

ratio
(taking
into
account
instanton
liquids
in
the
CMB)
exposed
a
extraordinary
principle:
a
conical
singularity
at
the
GUT
scale
lets
us
investigate
a
compactification
of
central
charges
in
models
of
flavor.
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
test
of
breaking
of
diffeomorphism
symmetry.
when
obtaining
a
spontaneous

of
models
of
axions,
we
deduce
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
an
instanton
is
equivalent
to
analyzing
QCD
.
unsurprisingly,
Feynman

in

unified.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
key.
