On
Integrability
of
spinning
particle
motion
in
higher-dimensional
black
hole
spacetimes
\\
We
study
the
motion
of
a
classical
spinning
particle
(with
spin
degrees
of
freedom
described
by
a
vector
of
Grassmann
variables)
in
higher-dimensional
general
rotating
black
hole
spacetimes
with
a
cosmological
constant.
In
all
dimensions
n
we
exhibit
n
bosonic
functionally
independent
integrals
of
spinning
particle
motion,
corresponding
to
explicit
and
hidden
symmetries
generated
from
the
principal
conformal
Killing--Yano
tensor.
Moreover,
we
demonstrate
that
in
4-,
5-,
6-,
and
7-dimensional
black
hole
spacetimes
such
integrals
are
in
involution,
proving
the
bosonic
part
of
the
motion
integrable.
We
conjecture
that
the
same
conclusion
remains
valid
in
all
higher
dimensions.
Our
result
generalizes
