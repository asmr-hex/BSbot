Non-linear
superposition
law
and
Skyrme
crystals
\\
Exact
configurations
of
the
four
dimensional
Skyrme
model
are
presented.
The
static
configurations
have
the
profile
which
behaves
as
a
kink
and,
consequently,
the
corresponding
energy
momentum
tensor
describes
a
domain
wall.
Furthermore,
a
class
of
exact
time
periodic
Skyrmions
is
discovered.
Within
such
class,
it
is
possible
to
disclose
a
remarkable
phenomenon
which
is
a
genuine
effect
of
the
Skyrme
term.
For
a
special
value
of
the
frequency
the
Skyrmions
admit
a
non
linear
superposition
principle.
One
can
combine
two
or
more
exact
elementary
Skyrmions
(which
may
depend
in
a
non
trivial
way
on
all
the
space
like
coordinates)
into
a
new
exact
composite
Skyrmion.
Due
to
such
superposition
law,
despite
the
explicit
presence
of
non
linear
effects
in
the
energy
momentum
tensor,
the
interaction
energy
between
the
elementary
Skyrmions
can
be
computed
exactly.
The
relations
with
the
appearance
of
Skyrme
crystals
is
discussed.
