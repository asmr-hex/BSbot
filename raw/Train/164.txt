A
Smooth
Landscape:
Ending
Saddle
Point
Inflation
Requires
Features
to
be
Shallow
\\
We
consider
inflation
driven
near
a
saddle
point
in
a
higher
dimensional
field
space,
which
is
the
most
likely
type
of
slow
roll
inflation
on
the
string
theoretical
landscape;
anthropic
arguments
need
to
be
invoked
in
order
to
find
a
sufficiently
flat
region.
To
give
all
inflatons
large
masses
after
inflation
and
yield
a
small
but
positive
cosmological
constant,
the
trajectory
in
field
space
needs
to
terminate
in
a
hole
on
the
inflationary
plateau,
introducing
a
curved
end-of-inflation
hypersurface.
We
compute
non-Gaussianities
(bi-
and
tri-spectrum)
caused
by
this
curved
hyper-surface
and
find
a
negative,
potentially
large,
local
non-linearity
parameter.
To
be
consistent
with
current
observational
bounds,
the
hole
needs
to
be
shallow,
i.e.
considerably
wider
than
deep
in
natural
units.
To
avoid
singling
out
our
vacuum
as
special
(i.e.
more
special
than
a
positive
cosmological
constant
entails),
we
deduce
that
all
features
on
field
space
should
be
similarly
shallow,
severely
limiting
the
type
of
landscapes
one
may
use
for
inflationary
model
building.
