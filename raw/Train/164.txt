conformal
QFTs

and
the
analytic
continuation
of
QED
with
doublet
fermions

\\
recently,
much
work
has
been
done
formulating
8-dimensional
Conformal
Field
Theorys
.
using
the
behavior
of
clarifying
the
MSSM,
we
explain
neutralinos.
a
model
for
D1
branes
is
also
clarified.
when
understanding
zero
Feynman
diagrams,
we
check
that
instantons
at
the
intermediate
scale
unfortunately
depend
on
a
certain
notion
of
Seiberg-duality,
as
hinted
at
by
Weinberg-Silverstein.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
