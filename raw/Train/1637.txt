Silent
initial
conditions
for
cosmological
perturbations
with
a
change
of
space-time
signature
\\
Recent
calculations
in
loop
quantum
cosmology
suggest
that
a
transition
from
a
Lorentzian
to
an
Euclidean
space-time
might
take
place
in
the
very
early
Universe.
The
transition
point
leads
to
a
state
of
silence,
characterized
by
a
vanishing
speed
of
light.
This
behavior
can
be
interpreted
as
a
decoupling
of
different
space
points,
similar
to
the
one
characterizing
the
BKL
phase.
