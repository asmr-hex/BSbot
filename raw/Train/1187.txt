K-Decompositions

3d
Gauge
Theories
\\
This
paper
combines
several
new
constructions
in
mathematics
and
physics.
Mathematically,
we
study
framed
flat
PGL(K,C)
connections
on
a
large
class
of
3-manifolds
M
with
boundary.
We
introduce
a
moduli
space
of
framed
flat
connections
on
the
boundary
of
M
that
extend
to
M.
Our
goal
is
to
understand
it
as
a
Lagrangian
subvariety
in
the
symplectic
moduli
space
of
framed
flat
connections
on
the
boundary,
and
to
provide
the
data
needed
to
quantize
it.
We
call
this
the
Lagrangian
pair
associated
to
M.
The
basic
example,
an
elementary
Lagrangian
pair,
is
for
M
a
tetrahedron
and
K=2.
Our
essential
geometric
tool
is
the
hypersimplicial
K-decomposition
of
M
related
to
an
ideal
triangulation.
By
restricting
framed
flat
connections
to
tetrahedra,
and
localizing
further
to
octahedra
of
the
K-decomposition,
we
associate
an
elementary
Lagrangian
pair
to
every
octahedron.
Going
back,
we
reconstruct
the
Lagrangian
pair
associated
to
M
by
"symplectic
gluing"
of
elementary
pairs.
We
study
the
2-3
Pachner
moves
by
decomposing
them
into
elementary
cobordisms.
We
prove
that
our
Lagrangian
subvarieties
are
K_2-Lagrangians:
the
K_2-avatar
of
the
symplectic
form
restricts
on
them
to
zero.
