AdS
backgrounds
from
black
hole
horizons
\\
We
utilize
the
classification
of
IIB
horizons
with
5-form
flux
to
present
a
unified
description
for
the
geometry
of
AdS_n,
n=3,5,7
solutions.
In
particular,
we
show
that
all
such
backgrounds
can
be
constructed
from
8-dimensional
2-strong
Calabi-Yau
geometries
with
torsion
which
admit
some
additional
isometries.
We
explore
the
geometry
of
AdS_3
and
AdS_5
solutions
but
we
do
not
find
AdS_7
solutions.
