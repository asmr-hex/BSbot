Spin
3
cubic
vertices
in
a
frame-like
formalism
\\
Till
now
most
of
the
results
on
interaction
vertices
for
massless
higher
spin
fields
were
obtained
in
a
metric-like
formalism
using
completely
symmetric
(spin-)tensors.
In
this,
the
Lagrangians
turn
out
to
be
very
complicated
and
the
main
reason
is
that
the
higher
the
spin
one
want
to
consider
the
more
derivatives
one
has
to
introduce.
In
this
paper
we
show
that
such
investigations
can
be
greatly
simplified
if
one
works
in
a
frame-like
formalism.
As
an
illustration
we
consider
massless
spin
3
particle
and
reconstruct
a
number
of
vertices
describing
its
interactions
with
lower
spin
2,
1
and
0
ones.
In
all
cases
considered
we
give
explicit
expressions
for
the
Lagrangians
and
gauge
transformations
and
check
that
the
algebra
of
gauge
transformations
is
indeed
closed.
