Emergent
geometry
in
N=6
Chern-Simons-matter
theory
\\
We
investigate
a
strong
coupling
expansion
of
N=6
superconformal
Chern-Simons
theory
obtained
from
the
semiclassical
analysis
of
low
energy,
effective
degrees
of
freedom
given
by
the
eigenvalues
of
a
certain
matrix
model.
We
show
how
the
orbifolded
sphere
S^7/Z_k
of
the
dual
geometry
emerges
dynamically
from
the
distribution
of
the
eigenvalues.
As
a
test
of
this
approach
we
compute
the
energy
of
off-diagonal
excitations,
finding
perfect
agreement
with
the
dispersion
relation
of
giant
magnons.
