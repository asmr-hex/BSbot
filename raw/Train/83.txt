Superconductivity,
Superfluidity
and
Holography
\\
This
is
a
concise
review
of
holographic
superconductors
and
superfluids.
We
highlight
some
predictions
of
the
holographic
models
and
the
emphasis
is
given
to
physical
aspects
rather
than
to
the
technical
details,
although
some
references
to
understand
the
latter
are
systematically
provided.
We
include
gapped
systems
in
the
discussion,
motivated
by
the
physics
of
high-temperature
superconductivity.
In
order
to
do
so
we
consider
a
compactified
extra
dimension
(with
radius
R),
or,
alternatively,
a
dilatonic
field.
The
first
setup
can
also
be
used
to
model
cylindrical
superconductors;
when
these
are
probed
by
an
axial
magnetic
field
a
universal
property
of
holography
emerges:
while
for
large
R
(compared
to
the
other
scales
in
the
problem)
non-local
operators
are
suppressed,
leading
to
the
so
called
Little-Parks
periodicity,
the
opposite
limit
shows
non-local
effects,
e.g.
the
uplifting
of
the
Little-Parks
periodicity.
This
difference
corresponds
in
the
gravity
side
to
a
Hawking-Page
phase
transition.
