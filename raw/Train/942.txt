Some
Properties
of
Chiral
Dotted
Spinor
Superfields
\\
Chiral
superfields
with
multiple
dotted
Lorentz
spinor
indices
(`dotspinors')
are
important
in
the
analysis
of
supersymmetry
breaking
through
the
mechanisms
of
Cybersusy.
This
paper
describes
the
actions
for
massive
dotspinors
coupled
to
supersymmetric
gauge
theory
and
to
chiral
matter.
It
analyzes
the
free
equations
of
motion
and
mass
spectra
for
the
case
of
unbroken
supersymmetry.
The
general
form
of
the
Cybersusy
algebra
for
dotsupers
with
multiple
indices
is
also
discussed
briefly.
