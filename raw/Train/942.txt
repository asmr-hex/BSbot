Supermembrane
in
D=5:
component
action
\\
Based
on
the
connection
between
partial
breaking
of
global
supersymmetry,
coset
approach,
which
realized
the
given
pattern
of
supersymmetry
breaking,
and
the
Nambu-Goto
actions
for
the
extended
objects,
we
have
constructed
on-shell
component
action
for
N=1,
D=5
supermembrane
and
its
dual
cousins.
We
demonstrate
that
the
proper
choice
of
the
components
and
the
use
of
the
covariant
(with
respect
to
broken
supersymmetry)
derivatives
drastically
simplify
the
action:
it
can
be
represented
as
a
sum
of
four
terms
each
having
an
explicit
geometric
meaning.
