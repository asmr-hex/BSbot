next,
we
solve
the
SUSY
CP
problem.
we
calculate
that
a
fractional
D7
instanton
must
be
present
in
the
localization
case.
while
solving
hypersurface
defects,
we
predict
that,
without
regard
to
examples
of
"braneworld
regularization",
(p,q)
branes
at
SNO
are
equivalent
to
currents
in
type
IIA
strings
,
in
the
approximation
that
an
orientifold
plane
depends
on
the
solution
of
supersymmetric
QCD
compactified
on
the
moduli
space
of
Calabi-Yau
n-folds
with
discrete
monodromy.
actually,
while
studying
a
electric-dual
of
m-dimensional
QFTs
near
a
holomorphic
instanton,
we
calculate
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Strassler-Dirac,
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality
is
modified.
interestingly,
before
studying
regularization
in
gravity,
we
conjecture
that,
by
symmetry,
hyperkahler
quotients
on
S^n
are
primordial,
as
will
be
made
clear.
consequently,
our
results
demonstrate
that
type
IIB
surrounded
by
instantons
is
modified.
