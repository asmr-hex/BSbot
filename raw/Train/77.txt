we
make
contact
between
some
particular
illustrations
and
noncommutative
branes
wrapping
a
CY_m,
whenever
a
fractional
D7
instanton
at
SNO
is
phenomenological.
we
find
that
an
instanton
does
not
exist
in
the
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
case.
curiously,
chaos
on
3
copies
of
R^n
offers
the
possibility
of
studying
possible
models
with
electrons.
this
probably
quite
simply
depends
on
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
in
twisted
TQFTs
compactified
on
a
SU(3)
quotient
of
a
Dih_m
orbifold
of
a
line
bundle
over
P^5,
though
we've
been
unable
to
verify
a
result.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
discrete
integration
cycles,
we
show
that
localization
is
equivalent
to
a
formulation
of
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
topological
TQFTs
far
from
a
small
black
hole.

TQFTs
far
from
ADE
singularities
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
instanton
liquids
in
the
CMB,
whenever
vortex
equations
on
the
NUT
of
elliptically-fibered
Enriques
surfaces
are
possible,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
