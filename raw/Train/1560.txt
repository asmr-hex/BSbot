Notes
on
beta-deformations
of
the
pure
spinor
superstring
in
AdS(5)
x
S(5)
\\
We
study
the
properties
of
the
vertex
operator
for
the
beta-deformation
of
the
superstring
in
AdS(5)
x
S(5)
in
the
pure
spinor
formalism.
We
discuss
the
action
of
supersymmetry
on
the
infinitesimal
beta-deformation,
the
application
of
the
homological
perturbation
theory,
and
the
relation
between
the
worldsheet
description
and
the
spacetime
supergravity
description.
