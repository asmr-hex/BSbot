Scalar
potential
in
F(R)
supergravity
\\
We
derive
a
scalar
potential
in
the
recently
proposed
N=1
supersymmetric
generalization
of
f(R)
gravity
in
four
space-time
dimensions.
Any
such
higher-derivative
supergravity
is
classically
equivalent
to
the
standard
N=1
supergravity
coupled
to
a
chiral
(matter)
superfield,
via
a
Legendre-Weyl
transform
in
superspace.
The
Kaehler
potential,
the
superpotential
and
the
scalar
potential
of
that
theory
are
all
governed
by
a
single
holomorphic
function.
We
also
find
the
conditions
for
the
vanishing
cosmological
constant
and
spontaneous
supersymmetry
breaking,
without
fine-tuning,
which
define
a
no-scale
F(R)
supergravity.
The
F(R)
supergravities
are
suitable
for
physical
applications
in
the
inflationary
cosmology
based
on
supergravity
and
superstrings.
