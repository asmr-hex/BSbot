Electronic
zero
modes
of
vortices
in
Hall

of
gapped
graphene
\\
Recent
observation
of
a
metal-insulator
phase
transition
in
the
$\nu=0$
Hall
state
of
graphene
has
inspired
the
idea
that
charge
carriers
in
the
metallic
state
could
be
fractionally
charged
vortices.
We
examine
the
question
of
whether
vortices
in
particular
gapped
states
of
graphene
and
subject
to
external
magnetic
and
pseudo-magnetic
fields
could
have
the
mid-gap
zero
mode
electron
states
which
would
allow
them
to
be
charged.
