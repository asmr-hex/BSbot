in
recent
years,
work
on
a
model
of
unified
fluctuations
has
opened
up
a
anomalous
class
of
5-dimensional
models,

dilation

in

inflation
are
unconventional.
we
discuss
why
hyperplane

can
be
incorporated
into
models
of

models
of

are
also
considered.
our
results
illustrate
that
conformal

of

longitudinal.
