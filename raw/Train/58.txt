Off-shell
symmetry
algebra
of
the
AdS_4
x
CP^3
superstring
\\
By
direct
calculation
in
classical
theory
we
derive
the
central
extension
of
the
off-shell
symmetry
algebra
for
the
string
propagating
in
AdS_4
x
CP^3.
It
turns
out
to
be
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
AdS_5
x
S^5
string.
We
also
elaborate
on
the
kappa-symmetry
gauge
and
explain,
how
it
can
be
chosen
in
a
way
which
does
not
break
bosonic
symmetries.
