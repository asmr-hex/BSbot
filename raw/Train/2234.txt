Living
in
Curved
Momentum
Space
\\
In
this
paper
we
review
some
aspects
of
relativistic
particles'
mechanics
in
the
case
of
a
non-trivial
geometry
of
momentum
space.
We
start
with
showing
how
the
curved
momentum
space
arises
in
the
theory
of
gravity
in
2+1
dimensions
coupled
to
particles,
when
(topological)
degrees
of
freedom
of
gravity
are
solved
for.
We
argue
that
there
might
exist
a
similar
topological
phase
of
quantum
gravity
in
3+1
dimensions.
Then
we
characterize
the
main
properties
of
the
theory
of
interacting
particles
with
curved
momentum
space
and
the
symmetries
of
the
action.
We
discuss
the
spacetime
picture
and
the
emergence
of
the
principle
of
relative
locality,
according
to
which
locality
of
events
is
not
absolute
but
becomes
observer
dependent,
in
the
controllable,
relativistic
way.
We
conclude
with
the
detailed
review
of
the
most
studied
kappa-Poincare
framework,
which
corresponds
to
the
de
Sitter
momentum
space.
