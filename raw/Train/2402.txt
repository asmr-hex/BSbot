Negative
mode
of
Schwarzschild
black
hole
from
the
thermodynamic
instability
\\
The
thermodynamic
instability,
for
example
the
negative
heat
capacity,
of
a
black
hole
implies
the
existence
of
off-shell
negative
mode(s)
(tachyonic
mode(s))
around
the
black
hole
geometry
in
the
Euclidean
path
integral
formalism
of
quantum
gravity.
We
explicitly
construct
an
off-shell
negative
mode
inspired
from
the
negative
heat
capacity
in
the
case
of
Schwarzschild
black
hole
with/without
a
cosmological
constant.
We
carefully
check
the
boundary
conditions,
i.e.
the
regularity
at
the
horizon,
the
traceless
condition,
and
the
normalizability.
