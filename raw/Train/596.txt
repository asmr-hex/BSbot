Magnetic
Branes
Supported
by
Nonlinear
Electromagnetic
Field
\\
Considering
the
nonlinear
electromagnetic
field
coupled
to
Einstein
gravity
in
the
presence
of
cosmological
constant,
we
obtain
a
new
class
of
$d$-dimensional
magnetic
brane
solutions.
This
class
of
solutions
yields
a
spacetime
with
a
longitudinal
nonlinear
magnetic
field
generated
by
a
static
source.
These
solutions
have
no
curvature
singularity
and
no
horizons
but
have
a
conic
geometry
with
a
deficit
angle
$\delta
\phi$.
We
investigate
the
effects
of
nonlinearity
on
the
metric
function
and
deficit
angle
and
also
find
that
for
the
special
range
of
the
nonlinear
parameter,
the
solutions
are
not
asymptotic
AdS.
We
generalize
this
class
of
solutions
to
the
case
of
spinning
magnetic
solutions,
and
find
that
when
one
or
more
rotation
parameters
are
nonzero,
the
brane
has
a
net
electric
charge
which
is
proportional
to
the
magnitude
of
the
rotation
parameters.
Then,
we
use
the
counterterm
method
and
compute
the
conserved
quantities
of
these
spacetimes.
Finally,
we
obtain
a
constrain
on
the
nonlinear
parameter,
such
that
the
nonlinear
electromagnetic
field
is
conformally
invariant.
