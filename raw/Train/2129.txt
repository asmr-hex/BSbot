Two-loop

Theory
\\
Bethe
ansatz
equations
have
been
proposed
for
the
asymptotic
spectral
problem
of
AdS_4/CFT_3.
This
proposal
assumes
integrability,
but
the
previous
verification
of
weak-coupling
integrability
covered
only
the
su(4)
sector
of
the
ABJM
gauge
theory.
Here
we
derive
the
complete
planar
two-loop
dilatation
generator
of
N=6
superconformal
Chern-Simons
theory
from
osp(6|4)
superconformal
symmetry.
For
the
osp(4|2)
sector,
we
prove
integrability
through
a
Yangian
construction.
We
argue
that
integrability
extends
to
the
full
planar
two-loop
dilatation
generator,
confirming
the
applicability
of
the
Bethe
equations
at
weak
coupling.
Further
confirmation
follows
from
an
analytic
computation
of
the
two-loop
twist-one
spectrum.
