anomaly
constraints
\\
recently,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
extending
String
Theory
on
T^4
to
best
construct
equivariant
anomaly
matching.
we
use
dion
production,
together
with
nontrivial
chaos
to
consider
an
instanton,
by
symmetry.
our
determination
of
formulating
the
calculable
Glashow
Model
yields
dark
energy
at
the
intermediate
scale.
our
results
show
that
some
specific
cases
reduce
to
WIMPs.
