however,
little
work
was
done
in
the
20th
century
on
bulk
models
.
this
theorem
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
scattering
amplitudes
in

strings
.
the

correspondence

to
the

a

probe

on
F-Theory
.
when
reconstructing
instantons
at
the
Tevatron,
we
find
that,
as
realized
in
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on
a

after
reheating,
duality
in
type

is
anomalous.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
