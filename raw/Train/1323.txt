Quark-Quark
Forces

\\
By
single-time
reduction
technique
of
Bethe-Salpeter
formalism
for
two-fermion
systems
analytical
expressions
for
the
quasipotential
of
quark-quark
interactions
in
QCD
have
been
obtained
in
one-gluon
exchange
approximation.
The
influence
of
infrared
singularities
of
gluon
Green`s
functions
on
the
character
of
quark-quark
forces
in
QCD
has
been
investigated.
The
way
the
asymptotic
freedom
manifests
itself
in
terms
of
two-quark
interaction
quasipotential
in
quantum
chromodynamics
is
shown.
Consistent
relativistic
consideration
of
quark
interaction
problem
by
single-time
reduction
technique
in
QFT
allows
one
to
establish
a
nontrivial
energy
dependence
of
the
two-quark
interaction
quasipotential.
As
a
result
of
the
energy
dependence
of
the
interaction
quasipotential,
the
character
of
the
forces
changes
qualitatively
during
the
transition
from
the
discrete
spectrum
(the
region
of
the
negative
values
of
the
binding
energy)
to
the
continuous
spectrum
(that
of
the
positive
values
of
the
binding
energy):
the
smooth
behaviour
of
the
interaction
quasipotential
in
the
discrete
spectrum
goes
into
the
oscillation
in
the
continuous
spectrum.
This
result
gives
a
visual
physical
picture
where
the
oscillations
may
be
interpreted
as
a
manifestation
of
a
quasicrystall
structure
of
the
vacuum.
