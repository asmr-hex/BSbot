What
the
information
paradox
is
{\it
not}
\\
There
still
exist
many
confusions
about
the
black
hole
information
paradox
and
its
resolution.
We
first
give
a
precise
formulation
of
the
paradox,
in
four
steps
A-D.
Then
we
examine
several
proposals
for
resolving
the
paradox.
We
note
that
in
each
case
one
of
these
four
steps
has
been
ignored,
so
that
the
proposal
does
not
really
target
the
essence
of
the
paradox.
Finally,
we
give
a
brief
summary
of
the
fuzzball
construction
and
argue
that
it
resolves
the
paradox
in
string
theory.
This
resolution
contains
a
deep
lesson
--
the
phase
space
of
quantum
gravity
is
so
large
that
the
measure
in
the
path
integral
can
compete
with
the
classical
action
for
macroscopic
objects
undergoing
gravitational
collapse.
