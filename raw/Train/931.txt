On
Geodesic
Motion
in
Horava-Lifshitz
Gravity
\\
We
propose
an
action
for
a
free
particle
in
Horava-Lifshitz
gravity
based
on
Foliation
Preserving
Diffeomorphisms.
The
action
reduces
to
the
usual
relativistic
action
in
the
low
energy
limit
and
allows
for
subluminal
and
superluminal
motions
with
upper
and
lower
bounds
on
velocity
respectively.
We
find
that
deviation
from
general
relativity
is
governed
by
a
position
dependent
coupling
constant
which
also
depends
on
the
mass
of
the
particle.
As
a
result,
light-like
geodesics
are
not
affected
whereas
massive
particles
follow
geodesics
that
become
mass
dependent
and
hence
the
equivalence
principle
is
violated.
We
make
an
exact
study
for
geodesics
in
flat
space
and
a
qualitative
analysis
for
those
in
a
spherically
symmetric
curved
background.
