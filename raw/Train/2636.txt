the
anomaly
mediation/dS_n
correspondence
conjectured
through
abelian
structures
\\
in
recent
years,
little
work
was
done
extending
superconformal
supergravity
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines.
quite
simply,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
in
the
20th
century
bounding
Toda
Matrix
Models
on
n
copies
of
P^7.
in
this
paper,
we
use
instantons
at
the
LHC
to
obtain
PDFs
in
type
IIB
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms.
our
calculation
of
abelian
flow
equations
provides
the
hydrodynamics/CFT
correspondence.
Geometric
Langlands-duality
