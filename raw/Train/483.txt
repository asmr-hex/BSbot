Near
Horizon
of
5D
Rotating
Black
Holes
from
2D
Perspective
\\
We
study
the
CFT
dual
to
five
dimensional
extremal
rotating
black
holes,
by
investigating
the
two
dimensional
perspective
of
their
near
horizon
geometry.
From
two
dimensional
point
of
view,
we
show
that
both
gauge
fields,
related
to
the
two
rotations,
appear
in
the
same
manner
in
the
asymptotic
symmetry
and
in
the
associated
central
charge.
We
find
that,
our
results
are
in
perfect
agreement
with
the
generalization
of
Kerr/CFT
approach
to
five
dimensional
extremal
rotating
black
holes.
