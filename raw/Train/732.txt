Interacting
agegraphic
quintessence
dark
energy
in
non-flat
universe
\\
We
suggest
a
correspondence
between
interacting
agegraphic
dark
energy
models
and
the
quintessence
scalar
field
in
a
non-flat
universe.
We
demonstrate
that
the
agegraphic
evolution
of
the
universe
can
be
described
completely
by
a
single
quintessence
scalar
field.
Then,
we
reconstruct
the
potential
of
the
interacting
agegraphic
quintessence
dark
energy
as
well
as
the
dynamics
of
the
scalar
field
according
to
the
evolution
of
the
agegraphic
dark
energy.
