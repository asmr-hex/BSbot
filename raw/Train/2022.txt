Some
field-theoretical
aspects
of
two
types
of
the
Poincare
group
representations
\\
The
capabilities
of
some
approaches
to
the
relativistic
description
of
hadronic
states
with
any
rest
spin
are
analysed.
The
key
feature
in
the
Wigner's
construction
of
irreducible
representations
of
the
Poincare
group
which
makes
this
construction
fruitless
in
the
particle
physics
is
picked
out.
A
realization
of
unitary
irreducible
representations
of
the
Poincare
group
of
the
standard
type,
which
yet
have
never
been
considered,
is
discussed.
The
viability
of
the
description
of
hadrons
by
the
Poincare
group
representations
of
the
standard
type
in
the
space
of
the
infinite-component
ISFIR-class
fields
is
pointed
out.
