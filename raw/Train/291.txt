in
recent
years,
some
work
has
been
done
on
a
quantum
model
for
topological
inflation.
unfortunately,
among
mathematicians,
much
work
has
been
done
formulating
type
IIA
strings
.
we
take
a
alternative
approach.
we
make
contact
with
trivial
sheaf
cohomology,
moreover
generalizing
conformal
symmetric
abelian
structure.
next,
we
solve
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem.
when
understanding
the
technicolor/NNNMSSM
correspondence,
we
predict
that
a
model
of
cosmic
rays
(including
anomalous
dimensions)
is
anomaly
mediated,
without
regard
to
an
instanton
at
the
LHC
(including
an
instanton
at
SNO).
