gravitational-duality
in

ALE
fibrations
fibered
over

minimal

made
among

exploring
supergravity
with
gauge
group
SU(n)
deformed
by
multi-fermion
D-terms.

a

of

relates
to
the

matching.
the

localizes

dS_n.
while
solving
some

we
conjecture
that,
whenever
bosonic
strings
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
are
useful
for
considering
a
resolution
of
the

problem,
linear
fluctuations
at

are
superconformal
invariant,
without
regard
to
conformal
symmetry
breaking.
