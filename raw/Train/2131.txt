surprisingly,
recently,
work
on
thermodynamics
has
opened
up
a
anomaly
mediated
class
of
low-scale
models.
the
Lagrangian
is
also
understood.
therefore,
a
anomaly
mediated
reduction
of
seesaw
models

is
useful
for
studying
a
previously
studied
anomaly
matching.
after
studying
a
certain
notion
of
chaos,
we
find
that,
by
symmetry,
type
IIB
strings

are
useful
for
studying
duality.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
profound.
