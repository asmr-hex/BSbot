String

a

are
entropic

reconstructing
extremal
CFTs
deformed
by

terms
is
usually
calculated
from
the
Wilsonian

action
in

models
with
neutrinos
(excluding
monopoles).
actually,
abelian
duality
is
usually
checked
by
duality
(taking
into
account
vortices
on
a
rational
surface
with
abelian
flux).
we
use
instantons
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy,
together
with
Donaldson
polynomials
on
the
moduli
space
of
linear
dilaton
backgrounds
with
equivariant
monodromy
to
calculate
W-bosons.
topological

our

demonstrate
that

leave
the

for
