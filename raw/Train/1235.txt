Hyperscaling
violating
Lifshitz
holography
\\
We
present
an
overview
of
the
construction
of
the
general
holographic
dictionary
for
asymptotically
locally
Lifshitz
and
hyperscaling
violating
Lifshitz
backgrounds
with
arbitrary
dynamical
exponents
$z$
and
$\theta$,
compatible
with
the
null
energy
condition,
which
was
recently
developed
in
[1,2].
A
concrete
definition
of
asymptotically
locally
Lifshitz
and
hyperscaling
violating
Lifshitz
backgrounds
is
provided
in
the
context
of
a
generic
bottom-up
Einstein-Proca-Dilaton
theory,
and
a
systematic
procedure
for
solving
the
radial
Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
via
a
covariant
expansion
in
eigenfunctions
of
two
commuting
operators
is
presented.
The
resulting
asymptotic
solution
of
the
Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
is
subsequently
used
to
derive
the
full
holographic
dictionary,
including
the
Fefferman-Graham
asymptotic
expansions
and
the
non-relativistic
holographic
Ward
identities.
