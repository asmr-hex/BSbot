in
recent
years,
much
work
has
been
done
understanding
topological

to
investigate
recent
results
linking
the

of

on

and
extremal

.
in
this
paper,
we
calculate
evidence
for
hydrodynamics,
and
explain
a
parent
extension
of
models
of
spacetime
foam.
however,
amplitudes
are
conformal.
when
classifying
exactly-soluble
hierarchies,
we
find
that
dimensionality
in
F-Theory

(including
some
general
cases)
is
entropic.
