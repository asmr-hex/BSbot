Stability
of
magnetic
condensation
and
mass
generation
for
confinement
in
SU(2)
Yang-Mills
theory
\\
In
the
framework
of
the
functional
renormalization
group,
we
reexamine
the
stability
of
the
Yang-Mills
vacuum
with
a
chromomagnetic
condensation.
We
show
that
the
Nielsen-Olesen
instability
of
the
Savvidy
vacuum
with
a
homogeneous
chromomagnetic
condensation
disappears
in
the
$SU(2)$
Yang-Mills
theory.
As
a
physical
mechanism
for
maintaining
the
stability
even
for
the
small
infrared
cutoff,
we
argue
that
dynamical
gluon
mass
generation
occurs
due
to
a
BRST-invariant
vacuum
condensate
of
mass
dimension-two,
which
is
related
to
two-gluon
bound
states
identified
with
glueballs.
These
results
support
the
dual
superconductor
picture
for
quark
confinement.
