dimensional
gravity
from

models
\\
We
obtain
2
+
1
dimensional
gravity
with
cosmological
constant
which
is
coupled
to
gauge
fields,
using
Maxwell
and
semi-simple
extension
of
the
Poincare
gauge
symmetric
models
(i.e.
Chern-Simons
models
with
these
gauge
groups).
Also
we
obtain
some
Ads
and
BTZ
type
solutions
for
the
classical
equations
of
motion
for
these
2
+
1
dimensional
gravities.
For
the
semi-simple
extension
of
the
Poincare
gauge
group
we
investigate
the
Ads/CFT
correspondence
and
show
that
the
model
at
the
boundary
is
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
three
WZW
models
over
group
SO(2,
1).
Then,
we
show
that
the
central
charge
of
the
CFT
is
the
same
as
that
of
CFT
at
the
boundary
of
Ads
spacetime
related
to
the
Chern-Simons
model
with
gauge
group
SO(2,
2).
