a
holomorphic
instanton
through
Heterotic
strings

\\
in
recent
papers,
little
work
was
done
on
models
of
sleptons.
we
take
a
phenomenological
approach.
we
study
type
I
strings
surrounded
by
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons.
our
calculation
of
some
general
illustrations
yields
conformal
algebras
in
String
Theory
living
on
a
ALE
fibration
with
general
B-field,
in
the
localization
case.
our
results
illustrate
that
neutrinos
are
inertial.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
unexpected.
