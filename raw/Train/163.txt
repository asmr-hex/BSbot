A
path
integral
approach
to
the
Langevin
equation
\\
We
study
the
Langevin
equation
both
with
a
white
noise
and
a
colored
noise.
We
construct
the
Lagrangian
as
well
as
the
Hamiltonian
for
the
generalized
Langevin
equation
which
leads
naturally
to
a
path
integral
description.
We
show
that
the
transition
amplitude,
in
this
case,
is
the
generating
functional
for
correlation
functions.
We
work
out
explicitly
the
correlation
functions
for
the
Markovian
process
of
the
Brownian
motion
of
a
free
particle
as
well
as
for
that
of
the
non-Markovian
process
of
the
Brownian
motion
of
a
harmonic
oscillator
(Uhlenbeck-Ornstein
model).
The
path
integral
description
also
leads
to
a
simple
derivation
of
the
Fokker-Planck
equation
for
the
generalized
Langevian
equation.
