The
internal
4-form
field
strengths
with
7-dimensional
indices
have
been
constructed
by
de
Wit
and
Nicolai
in
1986.
They
are
determined
by
the
following
six
quantities:
the
56-bein
of
4-dimensional
N=8
gauged
supergravity,
the
Killing
vectors
on
the
round
seven-sphere,
the
covariant
derivative
acting
on
these
Killing
vectors,
the
warp
factor,
the
field
strengths
with
4-dimensional
indices
and
the
7-dimensional
metric.
