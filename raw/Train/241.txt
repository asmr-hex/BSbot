A
Walk
Through
Superstring
Theory
With
an
Application
to
Yang-Mills
Theory:
K-strings
and
D-branes
as
Gauge/Gravity
Dual
Objects
\\
Superstring
theory
is
one
current,
promising
attempt
at
unifying
gravity
with
the
other
three
known
forces:
the
electromagnetic
force,
and
the
weak
and
strong
nuclear
forces.
Though
this
is
still
a
work
in
progress,
much
effort
has
been
put
toward
this
goal.
A
set
of
specific
tools
which
are
used
in
this
effort
are
gauge/gravity
dualities.
This
thesis
consists
of
a
specific
implementation
of
gauge/gravity
dualities
to
describe
k-strings
of
strongly
coupled
gauge
theories
as
objects
dual
to
Dp-branes
embedded
in
confining
supergravity
backgrounds
from
low
energy
superstring
field
theory.
Along
with
superstring
theory,
k-strings
are
also
commonly
investigated
with
lattice
gauge
theory
and
Hamiltonian
methods.
A
k-string
is
a
colorless
combination
of
quark-antiquark
source
pairs,
between
which
a
color
flux
tube
develops.
The
two
most
notable
terms
of
the
k-string
energy
are,
for
large
quark
anti-quark
separation
L,
the
tension
term,
proportional
to
L,
and
the
Coulombic
1/L
correction,
known
as
the
Luscher
term.
This
thesis
provides
an
overview
of
superstring
theories
and
how
gauge/gravity
dualities
emerge
from
them.
It
shows
in
detail
how
these
dualities
can
be
used
for
the
specific
problem
of
calculating
the
k-string
energy
in
2
+
1
and
3
+
1
space-time
dimensions
as
the
energy
of
Dp-branes
in
the
dual
gravitational
theory.
A
detailed
review
of
k-string
tension
calculations
is
given
where
good
agreement
is
found
with
lattice
gauge
theory
and
Hamiltonian
methods.
In
reviewing
the
k-string
tension,
we
also
touch
on
how
different
representations
of
k-strings
can
be
described
with
Dp-branes
through
gauge/gravity
dualities.
The
main
result
of
this
thesis
is
how
the
Luscher
term
is
found
to
emerge
as
the
one
loop
quantum
corrections
to
the
Dp-brane
energy.
In
2+1
space-time
dimensions,
we
have
Luscher
term
data
to
compare
with
from
lattice
gauge
theory,
where
we
find
good
agreement.
