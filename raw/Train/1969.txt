Relativistic
diffusion
of
elementary
particles
with
spin
\\
We
obtain
a
generalization
of
the
relativistic
diffusion
of
Schay
and
Dudley
for
particles
with
spin.
The
diffusion
equation
is
a
classical
version
of
an
equation
for
the
Wigner
function
of
an
elementary
particle.
The
elementary
particle
is
described
by
a
unitary
irreducible
representation
of
the
Poincare
group
realized
in
the
Hilbert
space
of
wave
functions
in
the
momentum
space.
The
arbitrariness
of
the
Wigner
rotation
appears
as
a
gauge
freedom
of
the
diffusion
equation.
The
spin
is
described
as
a
connection
of
a
fiber
bundle
over
the
momentum
hyperbolic
space
(the
mass-shell).
Motion
in
an
electromagnetic
field,
transport
equations
and
equilibrium
states
are
discussed.
