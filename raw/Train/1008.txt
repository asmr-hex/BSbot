Quantum
field
theory
on
the
noncommutative
two-dimensional
Minkowski
space
with
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
potential
is
discussed
in
two
ways:
In
terms
of
a
continuous
set
of
generalised
eigenfunctions
of
the
wave
operator,
and
directly
in
position
space.
In
both
settings,
we
find
a
new
type
of
divergence
in
planar
graphs.
It
is
present
at
and
above
the
self-dual
point.
This
new
kind
of
divergence
might
make
the
construction
of
a
Minkowski
space
version
of
the
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
model
impossible.
