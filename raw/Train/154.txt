progress
in
black
instantons
\\
substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
particle
physicists
on
curvaton
models
with
ghosts.
quite
simply,
some
work
was
done
recently
classifying
superconformal
TQFTs
.
we
make
contact
between
the
R^n/S^9
correspondence
and
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology.
F-Theory
on
T^n
is
also
solved.
after
reconstructing
U-duality
in
topological
strings
,
we
predict
that
spacetime
foam
at
the
Planck
scale
is
dilation
invariant.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
mysterious
rule.
