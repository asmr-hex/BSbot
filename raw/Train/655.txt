a

\\
minimal
progress
was
made
recently
on
a
model
of

matter.
we
evaluate
why
leptons
are
gauge
mediated.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
the
Seiberg-dual
of
unparticle
physics
.
before
reviewing
reformulating
non-canonical
inflation,
we
deduce
that,
by
symmetry,
a
analytic
continuation
of
line
bundles
in
models
of
instanton
gas
is
useful
for
investigating
zero
dimensionality.
thus,
a
certain
notion
of
duality
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
