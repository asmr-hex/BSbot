from

\\
T-dualities

a
sophisticated
framework
for
investigating
currents
in
String
theories
on
S^n.
we
present
a
criterion
for
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
on
7
copies
of
P^1.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
condensates,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
multi-fermion
operators
on
del-Pezzos.
before
exploring
the
flavor
problem,
we
check
that,
with
the
help
of
entropy
in
the
early
universe,
perturbation
theory
in
perturbative
Matrix
Models

is
predictive.
