potential
as
a
bridge
between
nontopological
solitons
of
different
types
\\
We
apply
the
Hubbard-Stratanovich
transformation
to
the
Lagrangian
for
nontopological
solitons
of
the
Coleman
type
in
a
two-dimensional
theory.
The
resulted
theory
with
an
extra
real
scalar
field
can
be
supplemented
with
a
cubic
term
to
obtain
a
model
with
exact
analytical
solution.
