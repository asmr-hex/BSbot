we
take
a
conformal
approach
to
flavor
models
.
the
equivariant
structure
depends,
however,
on
whether
(p,q)
7-
branes
at
the
weak
scale
are
consistent.
Planck
regularization
in
type
IIB
near
special
lagrangian
instantons
can
be
interpreted
as
the
S-matrix.
moreover,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
over
the
last
decade
on
a
boundary
model
of
multi-field
fluctuations.
the
abelian
structure
depends,
curiously,
on
whether
dark
matter
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
can
be
incorporated
into
spacetime
foam
in
the
early
universe.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Gross.
