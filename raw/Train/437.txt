M5
spikes
and
operators
in
the
HVZ
membrane
theory
\\
In
this
note
we
study
some
aspects
of
the
so-called
dual
ABJM
theory
introduced
by
Hanany,
Vegh
&amp;
Zaffaroni.
We
analyze
the
spectrum
of
chiral
operators,
and
compare
it
with
the
spectrum
of
functions
on
the
mesonic
moduli
space
M=C^2\times
C^2/Z_k,
finding
expected
agreement
for
the
coherent
branch.
A
somewhat
mysterious
extra
branch
of
dimension
N^2
opens
up
at
the
orbifold
fixed
point.
We
also
study
BPS
solutions
which
represent
M2/M5
intersections.
The
mesonic
moduli
space
suggests
that
there
should
be
two
versions
of
this
spike:
one
where
the
M5
lives
in
the
orbifolded
C^2
and
another
where
it
lives
in
the
unorbifolded
one.
While
expectedly
the
first
class
turns
out
to
be
like
the
ABJM
spike,
the
latter
class
looks
like
a
collection
of
stacks
of
M5
branes
with
fuzzy
S^3
profiles.
This
shows
hints
of
the
appearance
of
the
global
SO(4)
at
the
non-abelian
level
which
is
otherwise
not
present
in
the
bosonic
potential.
We
also
study
the
matching
of
SUGRA
modes
with
operators
in
the
coherent
branch
of
the
moduli
space.
As
a
byproduct,
we
present
some
formulae
for
the
laplacian
in
conical
CY_4
of
the
form
C^n\times
CY_{4-n}.
