Algebraic
Curves
for
Factorized
String
Solutions
\\
We
show
how
to
construct
an
algebraic
curve
for
factorized
string
solution
in
the
context
of
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence.
We
define
factorized
solutions
to
be
solutions
where
the
flat-connection
becomes
independent
of
one
of
the
worldsheet
variables
by
a
similarity
transformation
with
a
matrix
$S$
satisfying
$S^{-1}d
S=const$.
Using
the
factorization
property
we
construct
a
well
defined
Lax
operator
and
an
associated
algebraic
curve.
The
construction
procedure
is
local
and
does
not
require
the
introduction
of
a
monodromy
matrix.
The
procedure
can
be
applied
for
string
solutions
with
any
boundary
conditions.
We
study
the
properties
of
the
curve
and
give
several
examples
for
the
application
of
the
procedure.
