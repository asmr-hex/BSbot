Theory
and
Supersymmetry
of
5D
Horizons
\\
We
prove
that
the
near-horizon
geometries
of
minimal
gauged
five-dimensional
supergravity
preserve
at
least
half
of
the
supersymmetry.
If
the
near-horizon
geometries
preserve
a
larger
fraction,
then
they
are
locally
isometric
to
AdS5.
Our
proof
is
based
on
Lichnerowicz
type
theorems
for
two
horizon
Dirac
operators
constructed
from
the
supercovariant
connection
restricted
to
the
horizon
sections,
and
on
an
application
of
the
index
theorem.
An
application
is
that
all
five-dimensional
horizons
admit
an
sl(2,R)
symmetry
subalgebra.
