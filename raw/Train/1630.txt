Gravity
assisted
solution
of
the
mass
gap
problem
for
pure
Yang-Mills
fields
\\
In
1979
Louis
Witten
demonstrated
that
stationary
axially
symmetric
Einstein
field
equations
and
those
for
static
axially
symmetric
self-dual
SU(2)
gauge
fields
can
both
be
reduced
to
the
same
(Ernst)
equation.
In
this
paper
we
use
this
result
as
point
of
departure
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
mass
gap
for
quantum
source-free
Yang-Mills
(Y-M)
fields.
The
proof
is
facilitated
by
results
of
our
recently
published
paper,
JGP
59
(2009)
600-619.
Since
both
pure
gravity,
the
Einstein-Maxwell
and
pure
Y-M
fields
are
described
for
axially
symmetric
configurations
by
the
Ernst
equation
classically,
their
quantum
descriptions
are
likely
to
be
interrelated.
Correctness
of
this
conjecture
is
successfully
checked
by
reproducing
(by
different
methods)
results
of
Korotkin
and
Nicolai,
Nucl.Phys.B475
(1996)
397-439,
on
dimensionally
reduced
quantum
gravity.
Consequently,
numerous
new
results
supporting
the
Faddeev-Skyrme
(F-S)
-type
models
are
obtained.
We
found
that
the
F-S-like
model
is
best
suited
for
description
of
electroweak
interactions
while
strong
interactions
require
extension
of
Witten's
results
to
the
SU(3)
gauge
group.
Such
an
extension
is
nontrivial.
It
is
linked
with
the
symmetry
group
SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)
of
the
Standard
Model.
This
result
is
quite
rigid
and
should
be
taken
into
account
in
development
of
all
grand
unified
theories.
Also,
the
alternative
(to
the
F-S-like)
model
emerges
as
by-product
of
such
an
extension.
Both
models
are
related
to
each
other
via
known
symmetry
transformation.
Both
models
possess
gap
in
their
excitation
spectrum
and
are
capable
of
producing
knotted/linked
configurations
of
gauge/gravity
fields.
In
addition,
the
paper
discusses
relevance
of
the
obtained
results
to
heterotic
strings
and
to
scattering
processes
involving
topology
change.
It
ends
with
discussion
about
usefulness
of
this
information
for
searches
of
Higgs
boson.
