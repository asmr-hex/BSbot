a

\\
dark
energy
at
ATLAS
is
extended
inflationary.
moreover,
an
instanton
at
ATLAS
yields
a
pretty
framework
for
understanding
models
of
dark
matter.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
the
analytic
continuation
of
duality
in
a
model
for
condensates.
the
determination
of
examples
of
the
S-matrix
localizes
to
a
SU(m)
quotient
of
a
line
bundle
over
dS_m.
our
results
show
that
inflation
during
inflation
is
the
final
component
in
obtaining
a
A-type
brane
probe.
