Gauge
field
theories
with
covariant
star-product
\\
A
noncommutative
gauge
theory
is
developed
using
a
covariant
star-product
between
differential
forms
defined
on
a
symplectic
manifold,
considered
as
the
space-time.
It
is
proven
that
the
field
strength
two-form
is
gauge
covariant
and
satisfies
a
deformed
Bianchi
identity.
The
noncommutative
Yang-Mills
action
is
defined
using
a
gauge
covariant
metric
on
the
space-time
and
its
gauge
invariance
is
proven
up
to
the
second
order
in
the
noncommutativity
parameter.
