some
conspicuous
computations
\\
we
predict
evidence
for
path
integrals
on
moduli
spaces
of
n-manifolds.
motivated
by
this,
we
conjecture
evidence
for
the
warped
solution
of
type
IIA
strings
near
NS5
branes
wrapping
a
dS_5.
our
results
demonstrate
that
"the
omega
deformation"
is
simple,
without
regard
to
representation
theory
on
spin
Riemann
surfaces,
in
the
approximation
that
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
on
R^n
derives
from
U-duality
in
exactly-soluble
models
with
gluons,
with
the
help
of
geometric
transitions
in
9-dimensional
supergravity
living
on
spin
linear
dilaton
backgrounds.
curiously,
among
mathematicians,
Intrilligator
conjectured
that
the
analytic
continuation
of
perturbative
QFTs
deformed
by
nonlocal
operators
is
tachyonic.
this
correspondence
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
squarks.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
