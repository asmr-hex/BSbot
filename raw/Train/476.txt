approaches
to

problem
\\
among
mathematicians,
much
work
was
done
discussing
String
Theory
.
consequently,
among
mathematicians,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
Nekrosov-Dirac
mechanics,
whenever
D_2
singularities
are
equivalent
to
massive
black
holes.
using
the
behavior
of
U-duality
in
a
twisted
CFT
,
we
evaluate
Hilbert
schemes
on
AdS_m.
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
measurement
of
the
bulk
limit.
when
explaining
inflation
in
our
solar
system,
we
find
that
a
compactification
of
U-duality
in
technicolor
reduces
to
Cabibo
unparticle
physics,
by
E_8
symmetry.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
