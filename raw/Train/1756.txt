On
effective
actions
of
BPS
branes
and
their
higher
derivative
corrections
\\
We
calculate
in
detail
the
disk
level
S-matrix
element
of
one
Ramond-Ramond
field
and
three
gauge
field
vertex
operators
in
the
world
volume
of
BPS
branes,
to
find
four
gauge
field
couplings
to
all
orders
of
$\alpha'$
up
to
on-shell
ambiguity.
Then
using
these
infinite
couplings
we
find
that
the
massless
pole
of
the
field
theory
amplitude
is
exactly
equal
to
the
massless
pole
S-matrix
element
of
this
amplitude
for
the
$p=n$
case
to
all
orders
of
$\alpha'$.
Finally
we
show
that
the
infinite
massless
poles
and
the
contact
terms
of
this
amplitude
for
the
$p=n+2$
case
can
be
reproduced
by
the
Born-Infeld
action
and
the
Wess-Zumino
actions
and
by
their
higher
derivative
corrections.
