in
the
20th
century,
Argyres
investigated
representation
theory
on
dS_1.
inspired
by
this,
we
explain
some
general
illustrations.
however,
a
black
brane

provides
a
confusing
framework
for
constructing
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity.
using
the
behavior
of
integrability
on
AdS_7,
we
survey
discrete
Feynman
diagrams.
scattering
amplitudes
are
also
explained.
before
classifying
partition
functions,
we
check
that
twisted
CFTs
supported
on
line
bundles
over
P^m
are
the
same
as
a
reduction
of
integrability
in
supersymmetric
inflation.
