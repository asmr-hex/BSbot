Non-Perturbative
Quantum
Geometry
\\
The
beta-ensemble
with
cubic
potential
can
be
used
to
study
a
quantum
particle
in
a
double-well
potential
with
symmetry
breaking
term.
The
quantum
mechanical
perturbative
energy
arises
from
the
ensemble
free
energy
in
a
novel
large
N
limit.
A
relation
between
the
generating
functions
of
the
exact
non-perturbative
energy,
similar
in
spirit
to
the
one
of
Dunne-Unsal,
is
found.
The
exact
quantization
condition
of
Zinn-Justin
and
Jentschura
is
equivalent
to
the
Nekrasov-Shatashvili
quantization
condition
on
the
level
of
the
ensemble.
Refined
topological
string
theory
in
the
Nekrasov-Shatashvili
limit
arises
as
a
large
N
limit
of
quantum
mechanics.
