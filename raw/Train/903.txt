Black
Five-Branes
and
Fluxbranes
on
Gravitational
Instantons
\\
We
apply
a
U-duality
based
solution-generating
technique
to
construct
supergravity
solutions
which
describe
nonextremal
D5-branes
and
fluxbranes
on
various
gravitational
instantons.
This
includes
an
F7-brane
wrapped
on
a
sphere,
which
remains
weakly-coupled
in
the
asymptotic
region.
We
construct
various
superpositions
of
nonextremal
D5-branes
and
fluxbranes
that
have
angular
momentum
fixed
by
the
parameters
associated
with
their
mass
and
two
magnetic
charges.
