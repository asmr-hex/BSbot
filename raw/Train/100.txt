Half-BPS
Solutions

to
AdS_3

\\
Type
IIB
superstring
theory
has
AdS_3
x
S^3
x
M_4
(where
the
manifold
M_4
is
either
K_3
or
T^4)
solutions
which
preserve
sixteen
supersymmetries.
In
this
paper
we
consider
half-BPS
solutions
which
are
locally
asymptotic
to
AdS_3
x
S^3
x
M_4
and
preserve
eight
of
the
sixteen
supersymmetries.
We
reduce
the
BPS
equations
and
the
Bianchi
identity
for
the
self-dual
five-form
field
to
a
set
of
four
differential
equations.
The
complete
local
solution
can
be
parameterized
in
terms
of
two
harmonic
and
two
holomorphic
functions
and
all
bosonic
fields
have
explicit
expressions
in
terms
of
these
functions.
