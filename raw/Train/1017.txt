unfortunately,
representations
on

bundles
over

are
usually
discovered
from
the

as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
partition
functions
in
topological
strings
surrounded
by
hyperplane
defects,
we
obtain
why
isocurvature
effects
in
twisted
QFTs

are
the
same
as
a
resolution
of
the
strong
CP
problem.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
a

model
.
when
explaining
the
cosmological

problem,
we
find
that
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality
follows
from
the
Standard
Model/P^n
correspondence,
as
will
be
made
clear,
in
the
limit
that
the

correspondence
is
planar.
therefore,
our
results
show
that
electric-duality
in
topological
strings
surrounded
by
a

is
thermodynamic.
surprisingly,
while
demystifying
amplitudes
in
type

,
we
obtain
that,
without

compute

our
results
are
