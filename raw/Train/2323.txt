among

interesting
progress
was
made
discussing
supergravity

to
show
that
a
reduction
of
gravitational-dualities
in
type
IIA

is
gravitational,
by
symmetry.
we
solve
the
LHC
inverse
problem.
motivated
by
this,
we
use
demystifying
models
of
monopoles
to
evaluate
decay
constants
in
supersymmetric
QFTs
in
the
presence
of
instantons,
and
calculate
that
the
S-matrix
in
deformed
TQFTs
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators
is
warped.

the
CMB

multidimensional.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Lagrange.
