Conserved
supercurrents
and
Fayet-Iliopoulos
terms
in
supergravity
\\
Recently
there
has
appeared
in
the
literature
a
sequence
of
papers
questioning
the
consistency
of
supergravity
coupled
to
Fayet-Iliopoulos
terms.
A
key
feature
of
these
arguments
is
a
demonstration
that
the
conventional
superspace
stress
tensor
fails
to
be
gauge
invariant.
We
briefly
show
here
how
this
can
be
understood
as
defining
the
stress
tensor
in
a
non-covariant
Brans-Dicke
frame
in
an
underlying
superconformal
theory.
When
converted
to
the
Einstein
frame,
the
inconsistency
vanishes,
which
is
consistent
with
the
emergence
of
a
global
symmetry
discussed
in
these
papers.
