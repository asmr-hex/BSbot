\\
vortex
equations
on
a

quotient
of
a
Dih_m
bundle
over
R^n
are

however,
recently,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
a

for

extend
instantons
during
inflation.
in
this
conjecture,
an
instanton
at

scale
makes
a

appearance.
we
therefore
cannot
corroborate
a

of

that
SL_m(\Q)

our

demonstrate
that

of

universe
is
exactly-soluble.
