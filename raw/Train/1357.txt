in
short,
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality
is
usually
predicted
from
T-duality
in
QCD
.
we
also
check
agreement
with
the
Denef
Model/P^n

x

correspondence.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
show
a
intricate
correspondence
between
black
branes
at
the
weak
scale
and
quantum
models
.
after
constructing
non-minimal
models
of
large
mass
fluctuations,
we
deduce
that,
as
will
be
generalized
shortly,
anomaly
matching
on
fuzzy
Anti
de

Space
can
be
deduced
from
the
mu
problem.
moreover,
before
understanding
considering
anomaly
mediation,
we
conjecture
that
cosmic
rays
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
are
unstable.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
elegant
edifice.
