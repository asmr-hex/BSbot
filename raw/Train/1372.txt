St√ºckelberg
Fields
on
the
Effective
p-brane
\\
We
demonstrate
the
one-to-one
correspondence
between
reparametrization
invariant
effective
actions
for
relativistic
p-branes
in
flat
target
space
and
effective
actions
for
transverse
brane
perturbations
with
non-linearly
realized
Poincar\'e
symmetry.
Starting
with
an
action
with
non-linearly
realized
symmetry
we
construct
the
corresponding
reparametrization
invariant
action
by
introducing
St\"uckelberg
fields.
They
combine
with
the
transverse
modes
to
form
a
Lorentz
vector.
The
manifest
Lorentz
symmetry
of
the
reparametrization
invariant
action
follows
directly
from
the
non-linearly
realized
Lorentz
symmetry
of
the
initial
action
in
terms
of
the
physical
modes.
