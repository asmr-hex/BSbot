a
non-scalar
compactification
of
thermodynamics
\\
in
recent
years,
work
on
models
of
cosmic
rays
has
opened
up
a
6-dimensional
class
of
unified
models.
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
the
flavor
problem
(taking
into
account
the
cosmological
constant
problem),
quite
simply
reformulating
some
general
paradigms.
this
conjecture
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
the
solution
of
models
of
instanton
liquids.
our
results
illustrate
that
a
hypersurface
defect
is
useful
for
deriving
the
solution
to
the
little
hierarchy
problem
from
entanglement
entropy
at
the
LHC.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
evaluating
QCD.
