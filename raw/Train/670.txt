The
periodic
sl(2|1)
alternating
spin
chain
encodes
(some
of)
the
properties
of
hulls
of
percolation
clusters,
and
is
described
in
the
continuum
limit
by
a
logarithmic
conformal
field
theory
(LCFT)
at
central
charge
c=0.
This
theory
corresponds
to
the
strong
coupling
regime
of
a
sigma
model
on
the
complex
projective
superspace
$\mathbb{CP}^{1|1}
=
\mathrm{U}(2|1)
/
(\mathrm{U}(1)
\times
\mathrm{U}(1|1))$,
and
the
spectrum
of
critical
exponents
can
be
obtained
exactly.
In
this
paper
we
push
the
analysis
further,
and
determine
the
main
representation
theoretic
(logarithmic)
features
of
this
continuum
limit
by
extending
to
the
periodic
case
the
approach
of
arXiv:0701117.
We
first
focus
on
determining
the
representation
theory
of
the
finite
size
spin
chain
with
respect
to
the
algebra
of
local
energy
densities
provided
by
a
representation
of
the
affine
Temperley-Lieb
algebra
at
fugacity
one.
We
then
analyze
how
these
algebraic
properties
carry
over
to
the
continuum
limit
to
deduce
the
structure
of
the
space
of
states
as
a
representation
over
the
product
of
left
and
right
Virasoro
algebras.
Our
main
result
is
the
full
structure
of
the
vacuum
module
of
the
theory,
which
exhibits
Jordan
cells
of
arbitrary
rank
for
the
Hamiltonian.
