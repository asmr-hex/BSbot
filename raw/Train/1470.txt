M-Theory
on
Deformed
Superspace
\\
In
this
paper
we
will
analyse
a
noncommutative
deformation
of
the
ABJM
theory
in
N=1
superspace
formalism.
We
will
then
analyse
the
BRST
and
the
anti-BRST
symmetries
for
this
deformed
ABJM
theory,
in
linear
as
well
as
non-linear
gauges.
We
will
show
that
the
sum
of
gauge
fixing
term
and
the
ghost
term
for
this
deformed
ABJM
theory
can
be
expressed
as
a
combination
of
the
total
BRST
and
the
total
anti-BRST
variation,
in
Landau
and
non-linear
gauges.
We
will
show
that
in
Landau
and
Curci-Ferrari
gauges
this
deformed
ABJM
theory
is
invariant
under
a
additional
set
of
symmetry
transformations.
We
will
also
discuss
the
effect
that
the
addition
of
a
bare
mass
term
has
on
this
theory.
