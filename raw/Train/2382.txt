Abelian
Projections
of
the
Mass-deformed
ABJM
theory
and
Weakly
Curved
Dual
Geometry
\\
We
construct
${\cal
N}=2,4$
supersymmetric
abelian
projections
of
the
${\cal
N}=6$
mass-deformed
ABJM
theory.
There
are
well-defined
dual
background
geometries
for
the
${\cal
N}=2$
abelian
theory,
while
those
geometries
are
unclear
for
the
${\cal
N}=4$
abelian
theory.
The
${\cal
N}=2$
theory
is
built
on
the
supersymmetric
vacua
of
the
mass-deformed
ABJM
theory,
which
are
proven
to
have
one-to-one
correspondence
with
the
${\mathbb
Z}_k$
quotient
of
Lin-Lunin-Maldacena
geometries.
We
select
one
special
vacuum
of
the
mass-deformed
ABJM
theory
and
show
that
the
corresponding
geometry
is
weakly
curved
at
every
point
of
the
entire
space
transverse
to
the
M2-branes
in
the
large
$N$
limit.
