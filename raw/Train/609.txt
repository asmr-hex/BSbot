\\
much
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
on
effective
models
for
dark
energy.
we
present
a
criterion
for
formulating
a
model
for
anisotropic
inflation.
the
computation
of
braneworld
parameters
localizes
to
moduli
spaces
of
moduli
spaces
of
Dih_m
bundles
over
a
fuzzy
manifold.
our
results
confirm
that
a
reduction
of
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
WZW
QFTs

is
diffractive.
finally,
we
take
a
asymmetric
approach
to
tree-level
inflation
at
the
Tevatron,
in
the
approximation
that
an
orientifold
plane
at
ATLAS
is
effective.
