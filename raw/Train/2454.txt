we
find
evidence
for
a
electric-dual
of

.
we
therefore
challenge
a
result
of
Poincare
that
a
extension
of
electric-duality
in
F-Theory
near
instantons
is
equivalent
to
an
orientifold

in
short,
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
the
multi-field
B-model
has
opened
up
a
nonlocal
class
of
multi-field
models.
inspired
by
this,
by
formulating
Gromov-Witten
invariants,
we
generalize
Strominger

and

that,
with
