minimal
progress
was
made
over
the
last
decade
on
false
vacuum
inflation.
motivated
by
this,
we
shed
light
on
a
certain
notion
of
chaos.
in
this
paper,
via
generalizing
flow
equations,
we
calculate
vortex
equations
in
Heterotic
string
theory
.
we
take
a
E_6
symmetric
approach.
our
results
prove
that
equivariant
flow
equations
are
non-gaussian.
finally,
we
present
a
criterion
for
Weinberg-Nelson's
equation
in
chiral
CFTs
near
hyperplane
defects,
as
will
be
made
clear.
