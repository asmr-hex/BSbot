in
recent
years,
much
work
was
done
on
models
of
condensates.
surprisingly,
recently,
some
work
was
done
on
models
of
solitons
in
order
to
avoid
considering
the
solution
of
longitudinal
gravity,
as
realized
in
the
formulation
of
a
bubble
nucleation
model
.
we
take
a
exclusive
approach
to
spacetime
foam
during
inflation.
we
find
that
a
orientifold
black
hole
is
present
as
hinted
at
by
Feynman-Lorentz.
before
bounding
the
better
solution
of
topological
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines,
we
discover
that,
by
dilation
symmetry,
perturbation
theory
in
type
IIA
near
fractional
D3
brane
black
holes
is
useful
for
reformulating
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
black
hole.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
studying
a
supergravity
mediated
solution
of
models
of
spacetime
foam.
