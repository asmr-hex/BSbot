studying
models
of
entanglement
entropy
\\
localization
offers
the
possibility
of
investigating
the
formulation
of
vortex
equations
in
models
of
inflation.
we
solve
the
flavor
problem.
inspired
by
this,
we
calculate
why
the
scalar
field
alternative
compactification
of
a
cosmon
model

reduces
to
a
model
for
flavor.
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons
during
inflation
can
be
incorporated
into
Polchinski's
equations
in
perturbative
supergravity
.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
analyzing
condensates
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy.
