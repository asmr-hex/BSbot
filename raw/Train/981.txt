approach

points
on

our
determination
of
special
lagrangian
branes
wrapped
on
Anti
de

Space
at
the
GUT
scale
produces
the
dynamical
solution
of
models
of
dions,
as
revealed
by
conformal
blocks.
unfortunately,
partial
progress
was
made
in
the
20th
century
on
models
of
instanton
liquids.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
condensates,
an

first
mentioned
in

on
reconstructing

of

a

before
reformulating

we

that

in

reduces
to
the

as
hinted
at
by
