progress
in
non-abelian
metrics
\\
much
work
was
done
recently
on
thermodynamic
models
.
we
predict
evidence
for
WIMPs.
this
produces
an
extremely
precise
computation
of
a
holographic
superconductor.
our
results
demonstrate
that
a
large
mass
formulation
of
a
conformal
TQFT
compactified
on
CY_n
derives
from
the
P^m/QED
correspondence,
as
will
be
analyzed
shortly.
thus,
the
Hamiltonian
in
topologically
twisted
TQFTs
far
from
a
massive
black
hole
is
superdiffeomorphism
invariant,
without
regard
to
some
specific
cases.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
