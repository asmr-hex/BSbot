Super
Galilean
conformal
algebra
in
AdS/CFT
\\
Galilean
conformal
algebra
(GCA)
is
an
Inonu-Wigner
(IW)
contraction
of
a
conformal
algebra,
while
Newton-Hooke
string
algebra
is
an
IW
contraction
of
an
AdS
algebra
which
is
the
isometry
of
an
AdS
space.
It
is
shown
that
the
GCA
is
a
boundary
realization
of
the
Newton-Hooke
string
algebra
in
the
bulk
AdS.
The
string
lies
along
the
direction
transverse
to
the
boundary,
and
the
worldsheet
is
AdS_2.
The
one-dimensional
conformal
symmetry
so(2,1)
and
rotational
symmetry
so(d)
contained
in
the
GCA
are
realized
as
the
symmetry
on
the
AdS_2
string
worldsheet
and
rotational
symmetry
in
the
space
transverse
to
the
AdS_2
in
AdS_{d+2},
respectively.
It
follows
from
this
correspondence
that
32
supersymmetric
GCAs
can
be
derived
as
IW
contractions
of
superconformal
algebras,
psu(2,2|4),
osp(8|4)
and
osp(8^*|4).
We
also
derive
less
supersymmetric
GCAs
from
su(2,2|2),
osp(4|4),
osp(2|4)
and
osp(8^*|2).
