BPS
solution
for
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
with
a
conical
defect
configuration
\\
In
this
work,
we
found
the
solution
for
the
field
equations
of
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
with
a
BPS
conical
topological
defect
configuration.
We
chose
the
solutions
that
corresponded
to
a
M2-brane
where
the
space-time
presents
the
co-dimension
two.
The
source
of
the
topological
defect
is
a
sigma
model
where
the
brane
tension
is
connected
with
the
angular
deficit.
We
analyzed
the
Killing
spinor
equations,
a
3-form
gauge
potential
and
Einstein's
equations,
proving
that
it
is
possible
to
find
a
full
solution
for
the
system.
We
analyzed
the
near-horizon
limit
proving
that
it
is
possible
to
obtain
an
$AdS_4
\times
S^1
\times
\mathbb{E}^6
$
geometry
for
certain
values
of
the
brane
tension.
We
also
discussed
some
applications
in
the
strong
coupling
theory
for
condensed
matter
systems.
