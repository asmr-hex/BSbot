we
derive
evidence
for
a
du
Val
singularity
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
(including
perturbative
unparticle
physics
).
we
therefore
find
inconsistencies
with
a
result
of
Argyres
that
the
anomalous
Hilbert
space
(involving
the
solution
to
the
LHC
inverse
problem)
lets
us
shed
light
on
the
QED/QED
correspondence.
therefore,
in
recent
papers,
work
on
asymmetric
inflation
has
opened
up
a
consistent
class
of
large
mass
models.
our
calculation
of
N=9
QED
surrounded
by
conical
singularities
yields
the
flavor
reduction
of
gauge
mediation.
therefore,
the
unparticle
physics/QFT
correspondence
is
holographic.
before
studying
the
little
hierarchy
problem,
we
calculate
that
low
scale
inflation
after
reheating
is
equivalent
to
a
reduction
of
duality
in
perturbative
QCD
.
