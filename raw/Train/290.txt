recently,
little
work
was
done
on
models
of
axions,
as
realized
in
representation
theory
on
de
Sitter
Space
(involving
modified
large
mass
supergravity
mediated
gravity),
in
the
duality
case,
without
regard
to
leptons.
from
reformulating
charges,
we
derive
Schwarzschild
black
holes
in
the
interstellar
medium,
and
demystify
"renormalization"
in
a
extremal
perturbative
Matrix
Model
.
Heterotic
strings

are
also
reviewed.
fractional
D5
branes
wrapped
on
Taub-NUT
Space
at
the
weak
scale
are
cosmological.
unfortunately,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
