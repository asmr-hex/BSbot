Starobinsky
Model
in
N=2
Supergravity
\\
The
Starobinsky
inflationary
model
of
$(R+R^2)$
gravity
is
extended
to
the
new-minimal
(40+40)
off-shell
4D,
N=2
supergravity
in
N=2
chiral
(curved)
superspace.
In
its
dual
formulation,
as
a
matter-coupled
N=2
Einstein
supergravity,
inflaton
belongs
to
a
massive
N=2
vector
multiplet.
