Approximate
R-symmetries
and
the
mu
term
\\
We
discuss
the
role
of
approximate
U(1)_R
symmetries
for
the
understanding
of
hierarchies
in
Nature.
Such
symmetries
may
explain
a
suppressed
expectation
value
of
the
superpotential
and
provide
us
with
a
solution
to
the
MSSM
mu
problem.
We
present
various
examples
in
field
theory
and
string-derived
models.
