Introductory
Lectures
on
Multiple
Membranes
\\
These
lecture
notes
introduce
the
multiple
membrane
theories
known
as
BLG
and
ABJM.
We
assume
the
reader
is
familiar
with
string
theory,
but
not
with
M-theory,
11-dimensional
supergravity
or
membranes.
We
therefore
start
with
a
background
on
M-theory
and
its
extended
objects
before
discussing
BLG
and
ABJM.
The
link
to
string
theory
via
dimensional
reduction
will
be
maintained
throughout.
