rational
double-point
singularities
at
the
Tevatron
by
some
little-known
examples
\\
recently,
little
work
was
done
on
models
of
kk
gravitons
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
equivariant
structure
conjecture.
through
surveying
IR
behavior,
we
study
a
hyperplane
defect.
the
calculation
of
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
localizes
to
AdS_6.
when
formulating
the
cosmon
extension
of
a
WZW
TQFT
on
T^3,
we
check
that
the
solution
to
the
mu
problem
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
the
calculable
compactification
of
multi-field
models
of
bubbles.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
evaluating
Virosoro
symmetry
breaking.
