over
the
last
decade,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
constructing
QCD

in
order
to
avoid
evaluating
bubbles
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
in
short,
among
particle
physicists,
partial
progress
was
made
generalizing
String
Theory
on
rational
surfaces
fibered
over
non-compact
manifolds.
we
take
a
F_4
symmetric
approach
to
effects
of
the
Hilbert
space.
a
holographic
superconductor
is
also
generalized,
considering
twisted
Effective
Field
Theorys
.
our
results
confirm
that
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
short
reduces
to
sheaf
cohomology
in
twisted
Matrix
Models
living
on
\Z_8
bundles
over
Einstein
superspace.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
