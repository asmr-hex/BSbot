Could
the
dynamics
of
the
Universe
be
influenced
by
what
is
going
on
inside
black
holes?
\\
We
investigate
the
potential
impact
of
mass
inflation
inside
black
holes
on
the
dynamics
of
the
Universe,
considering
a
recent
reformulation
of
general
relativity,
proposed
in
[1],
which
prevents
the
vacuum
energy
from
acting
as
a
gravitational
source.
The
interior
dynamics
of
accreting
black
holes
is
studied,
at
the
classical
level,
using
the
homogeneous
approximation
and
taking
charge
as
a
surrogate
for
angular
momentum.
We
show
that,
depending
on
the
accreting
fluid
properties,
mass
inflation
inside
black
holes
could
influence
the
value
of
the
cosmological
constant
and
thus
the
dynamics
of
the
Universe.
A
full
assessment
of
the
cosmological
role
played
by
black
holes
will
require
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
extremely
energetic
regimes
expected
inside
real
astrophysical
black
holes,
including
their
relation
with
the
physics
of
the
very
early
Universe,
and
may
eventually
lead
to
an
entirely
new
paradigm
for
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
Universe.
