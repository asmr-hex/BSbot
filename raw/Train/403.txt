Supersymmetric
Extension
of
GCA
in

\\
We
derive
the
infinite
dimensional
Supersymmetric
Galilean
Conformal
Algebra
(SGCA)
in
the
case
of
two
spacetime
dimensions
by
performing
group
contraction
on
2d
superconformal
algebra.
We
also
obtain
the
representations
of
the
generators
in
terms
of
superspace
coordinates.
Here
we
find
realisations
of
the
SGCA
by
considering
scaling
limits
of
certain
2d
SCFTs
which
are
non-unitary
and
have
their
left
and
right
central
charges
become
large
in
magnitude
and
opposite
in
sign.
We
focus
on
the
Neveu-Schwarz
sector
of
the
parent
SCFTs
and
develop,
in
parallel
to
the
GCA
studies
recently
in
(
