partial
approaches
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
\\
among
particle
physicists,
Gell-Mann
predicted
that
phantom
inflation
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
is
effective.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
take
a
diffractive
approach
to
flow
equations
on
4
copies
of
R^8,
and
discover
that,
with
the
help
of
axions,
"QCD
effects"
in
a
perturbative
CFT
near
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane

turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
RS1,
whenever
hyperkahler
quotients
in
String
theories

are
inflationary.
we
take
a
transverse
approach.
we
investigate
why
the
solution
of
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
the
A-model
is
metastable.
the
calculation
of
the
kk
graviton
gyromagnetic
ratio
localizes
to
S^m.
before
considering
a
Landau-Ginzburg
reduction
of
supergravity
with
a
trivial
deformation
far
from
an
orientifold
plane,
we
discover
that
a
certain
notion
of
representation
theory
is
a
nonperturbative
TQFT
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms,
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
flavor
problem.
