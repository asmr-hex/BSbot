An
Alternative
to
Particle
Dark
Matter
\\
We
propose
an
alternative
to
particle
dark
matter
that
borrows
ingredients
of
MOdified
Newtonian
Dynamics
(MOND)
while
adding
new
key
components.
The
first
new
feature
is
a
dark
matter
fluid,
in
the
form
of
a
scalar
field
with
small
equation
of
state
and
sound
speed.
This
component
is
critical
in
reproducing
the
success
of
cold
dark
matter
for
the
expansion
history
and
the
growth
of
linear
perturbations,
but
does
not
cluster
significantly
on
non-linear
scales.
Instead,
the
missing
mass
problem
on
non-linear
scales
is
addressed
by
a
modification
of
the
gravitational
force
law.
The
force
law
approximates
MOND
at
large
and
intermediate
accelerations,
and
therefore
reproduces
the
empirical
success
of
MOND
at
fitting
galactic
rotation
curves.
At
ultra-low
accelerations,
the
force
law
reverts
to
an
inverse-square-law,
albeit
with
a
larger
Newton's
constant.
This
latter
regime
is
important
in
galaxy
clusters
and
is
consistent
with
their
observed
isothermal
profiles.
We
present
an
explicit
relativistic
theory
in
terms
of
two
scalar
fields.
The
first
scalar
field
is
governed
by
a
Dirac-Born-Infeld
action
and
behaves
as
a
dark
matter
fluid
on
large
scales.
The
second
scalar
field
also
has
single-derivative
interactions
and
mediates
a
fifth
force
that
modifies
gravity
on
non-linear
scales.
Both
scalars
are
coupled
to
matter
via
an
effective
metric
that
depends
locally
on
the
fields.
The
form
of
this
effective
metric
implies
the
equality
of
the
two
scalar
gravitational
potentials,
which
ensures
that
lensing
and
dynamical
mass
estimates
agree.
