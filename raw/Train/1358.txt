Non-geometric
fluxes
versus
(non)-geometry
\\
Non-geometry
has
been
introduced
when
considering
a
new
type
of
string
backgrounds,
for
which
stringy
symmetries
serve
as
transition
functions
between
patches
of
the
target
space.
Then,
some
terms
in
the
potential
of
four-dimensional
gauged
supergravities,
generated
by
so-called
non-geometric
fluxes,
have
been
argued
to
find
a
higher-dimensional
origin
in
these
backgrounds,
even
if
a
standard
compactification
on
those
cannot
be
made.
We
present
here
recent
results
clarifying
the
relation
between
these
two
settings.
Thanks
to
a
field
redefinition,
we
reformulate
the
NSNS
Lagrangian
in
such
a
way
that
the
non-geometric
fluxes
appear
in
ten
dimensions.
In
addition,
if
an
NSNS
field
configuration
is
non-geometric,
its
reformulation
in
terms
of
the
new
fields
can
restore
a
standard
geometry.
A
dimensional
reduction
is
then
possible,
and
leads
to
the
non-geometric
terms
in
the
four-dimensional
potential.
Reformulating
similarly
doubled
field
theory,
we
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
role
of
the
non-geometric
fluxes,
and
rewrite
the
Lagrangian
in
a
manifestly
diffeomorphism-covariant
manner.
We
finally
discuss
the
relevance
of
the
field
redefinition
and
the
non-geometric
fluxes
when
studying
the
non-commutativity
of
string
coordinates.
