Integrable
string
models
with
constant
torsion
in
terms
of
chiral
invariants
of
SU(n),
SO(n),
SP(n)
groups
\\
We
used
the
invariant
local
chiral
currents
of
principal
chiral
models
for
SU(n),
SO(n),
SP(n)
groups
to
construct
new
integrable
string
equations
of
hydrodynamic
type
on
the
Riemmann
space
of
the
chiral
primitive
invariant
currents
and
on
the
chiral
non-primitive
Casimir
operators
as
Hamiltonians.
