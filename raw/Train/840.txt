Anomaly
Induced
Transport
in
Arbitrary
Dimensions
\\
Motivated
by
the
consistency
of
a
global
anomaly
with
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics,
we
propose
a
form
for
the
anomaly
induced
charge/energy
transport
in
arbitrary
even
dimensions.
In
a
given
dimension,
this
form
exhausts
all
second
law
constraints
on
anomaly
induced
transport
at
any
given
order
in
hydrodynamic
derivative
expansion.
This
is
achieved
by
solving
the
second
law
constraints
off-shell
without
resorting
to
hydrodynamic
equations
at
lower
orders.
We
also
study
various
possible
finite
temperature
corrections
to
such
anomaly
induced
transport
coefficients.
