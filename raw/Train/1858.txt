Homological
algebra
of
knots
and
BPS
states
\\
It
is
known
that
knot
homologies
admit
a
physical
description
as
spaces
of
open
BPS
states.
We
study
operators
and
algebras
acting
on
these
spaces.
This
leads
to
a
very
rich
story,
which
involves
wall
crossing
phenomena,
algebras
of
closed
BPS
states
acting
on
spaces
of
open
BPS
states,
and
deformations
of
Landau-Ginzburg
models.
