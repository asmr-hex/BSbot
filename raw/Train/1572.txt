High

\\
The
recent
BICEP2
result
shows
that
the
Universe
once
has
gone
through
the
vacuum
with
the
GUT
scale
energy
density.
The
implied
high
scale
inflation
nullifies
the
dilution
idea
of
topological
defects,
strings
and
domain
walls,
of
the
axionic
system.
In
particular,
domain
walls
are
disastrous
if
the
domain
wall
problem
with
domain-wall
number
greater
than
1
is
present.
We
argue
that
the
model-independent
axion
in
string
compactification
with
the
anomalous
U(1)
gauge
symmetry
resolves
the
domain
wall
problem
naturally
with
a
symmetry
principle.
