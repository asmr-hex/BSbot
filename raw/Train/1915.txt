R-charges,

and
RG
Flows
in
Supersymmetric
Chern-Simons-Matter
Theories
\\
We
discuss
the
non-perturbative
behavior
of
the
U(1)_R
symmetry
in
N=2
superconformal
Chern-Simons
theories
coupled
to
matter
in
the
(anti)fundamental
and
adjoint
representations
of
the
gauge
group,
which
we
take
to
be
U(N).
Inequalities
constraining
this
behavior
are
obtained
as
consequences
of
spontaneous
breaking
of
supersymmetry
and
Seiberg
duality.
This
information
reveals
a
web
of
RG
flows
connecting
different
interacting
superconformal
field
theories
in
three
dimensions.
We
observe
that
a
subclass
of
these
theories
admits
an
ADE
classification.
In
addition,
we
postulate
new
examples
of
Seiberg
duality
in
N=2
and
N=3
Chern-Simons-matter
theories
and
point
out
interesting
parallels
with
familiar
non-perturbative
properties
in
N=1
(adjoint)
SQCD
theories
in
four
dimensions
where
the
exact
U(1)_R
symmetry
can
be
determined
using
a-maximization.
