Localization
of
relativistic
particles
and
uncertainty
relations
\\
Localization
of
relativistic
particles
and
their
position-momentum
uncertainty
relations
are
not
yet
fully
understood.
We
discuss
two
schemes
of
photon
localization
that
are
based
on
the
energy
density.
One
scheme
produces
a
positive
operator-valued
measure
for
localization.
It
coincides
with
the
number
density
operator
and
reproduces
the
effective
3x3
polarization
density
matrix.
Another
scheme
results
in
a
probability
distribution
that
is
conditioned
on
the
detection.
In
both
schemes
the
uncertainty
relations
for
transversal
position
and
momentum
approach
the
Heisenberg
bound

z=
\hbar/2$
