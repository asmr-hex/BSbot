Spectroscopy
of
Masses
and
Couplings
during
Inflation
\\
In
this
work,
we
extend
the
idea
of
Quasi
Single
Field
inflation
to
the
case
of
multiple
isocurvaton
fields
with
masses
of
order
of
Hubble,
which
are
coupled
kinetically
to
the
inflaton
field
and
have
some
interactions
among
themselves.
We
consider
the
effects
of
these
massive
modes
in
both
the
size
and
the
shape
of
the
bispectrum.
We
show
that
the
shape
of
the
bispectrum
in
the
squeezed
limit
is
dominated
by
the
lightest
field
and
is
the
same
as
in
Quasi
Single
Field
inflation.
This
is
a
generic
feature
of
multiple
isocurvaton
fields
and
is
independent
of
the
details
of
the
interactions
among
the
massive
fields.
When
the
isocurvaton
fields
have
similar
masses,
we
can
potentially
distinguish
two
different
shapes
in
the
squeezed
limit
so
that
the
shape
of
the
bispectrum
can
act
as
a
particle
detector.
However,
in
the
presence
of
hierarchy
among
the
massive
fields,
the
dominant
effect
is
due
to
the
lightest
field.
