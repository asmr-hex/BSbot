The
lift
of
type
IIA
supergravity
with
D6
sources:
M-theory
with
torsion
\\
This
paper
is
concerned
with
an
extension
of
the
well
known
Kaluza-Klein
mechanism.
As
the
standard
ansatz
for
Kaluza-Klein
reduction
implies
the
existence
of
a
gauge
potential
associated
with
the
KK
field
strength,
it
follows
immediately
that
this
field
strength
satisfies
its
Bianchi
identity.
Hence,
the
standard
KK
formalism
breaks
down
in
the
presence
of
a
violated
Bianchi
identity.
This
occurs
for
example
in
the
context
of
D6
sources.
