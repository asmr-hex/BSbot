progress
in
non-abelian
Maldacena-Argyres
equations
\\
we
determine
a
complicated
correspondence
between
examples
of
anomalous
dimensions
and
equivariant
metrics,
ultimately
classifying
that
F-Theory
deformed
by
BPS
operators
lets
us
analyze
representation
theory
in
type
IIB
strings
on
CY_m
x
CY_n.
our
computation
of
deformed
Matrix
Models
deformed
by
four-quark
operators
gives
modified
hierarchies
in
models
of
heavy-ions.
the
T^n/supergravity
correspondence
is
entropic.
thus,
after
reconstructing
AdS/CFT,
we
deduce
that,
as
realized
in
investigating
supergravity
deformed
by
four-quark
F-terms,
electric-duality
in
a
unparticle
model

can
be
incorporated
into
the
technicolor/quantum
dynamics
correspondence.
curiously,
the
formulation
of
topologically
twisted
TQFTs
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
ALF
space
with
Poincare
symmetric
fundamental
group
offers
the
possibility
of
reformulating
sheaf
cohomology
on
moduli
spaces
of
affine
bundles
over
manifolds
with
nonzero
spin-structure.
the
partition
function
is
also
understood,
at
least
in
the
context
of
some
general
cases.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
startling
edifice.
