Constraints
on
the
R-charges
of
Free
Bound
States
from
the
RÃ¶melsberger
Index
\\
The
R\"omelsberger
index
on
S^3
x
R
serves
as
a
powerful
test
for
conjectured
dualities,
relying
on
the
claim
that
this
object
is
an
RG-invariant.
In
this
work
we
support
this
claim
by
showing
that
the
singularities
suggested
by
Witten
of
"states
moving
in
from
infinity"
are
excluded
on
S^3
x
R.
In
addition,
we
provide
an
application
of
the
R\"omelsberger
index,
in
the
form
of
a
constraint
on
the
RG
flow
of
supersymmetric
theories.
The
constraint,
which
applies
for
asymptotically
free
theories
with
unbroken
supersymmetry
and
non-anomalous
R-symmetry,
is
the
following:
if
the
R-charges
of
the
chiral
multiplets
in
the
UV
theory
are
0&lt;q_i&lt;2
and
the
IR
theory
can
be
described
as
a
free
theory
of
chiral
bound
states,
then
the
R-charges
of
these
bound
states,
~q_j,
are
constrained
such
that
0&lt;~q_j&lt;2.
We
thus
provide
a
proof
of
a
weak
version
of
a
conjecture
proposed
by
Intriligator.
We
mention
some
applications
of
this
result.
