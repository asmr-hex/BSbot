quite
simply,
pion
production
in
a
model
of
spacetime
foam
yields
a
profound
framework
for
exploring
dimensionality
in
QED
.
using
the
behavior
of
the
analytic
continuation
of
general
relativity,
we
explain
cosmic
rays
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
F-Theory
,
we
solve
the
cosmic

problem.

the

surprisingly,
while
clarifying

$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
we
conjecture
that,
as
will
be

shortly,
nonzero

characters
are
tachyonic.
interestingly,
our
results
show
that

we

this

provides
a
good

for
considering

during
inflation.
