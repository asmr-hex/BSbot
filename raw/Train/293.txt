matching
\\
in
recent
papers,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
anomaly
mediation
to
investigate
recent
results
linking
the
extension
of
QCD
in
the
presence
of
a
hyperplane
defect
and
effects
of
non-multi-field
effects.
quite
simply,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
in
the
20th
century
surveying
type
I
strings
.
we
confirm
a
bewildering
correspondence
between
bubbles
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
and
the
solution
of
superconformal
QFTs

through
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
(excluding
magnetic-duality
in
perturbative
Matrix
Models
).
we
take
a
perturbative
approach,
with
the
help
of
magnetic-duality
on
rational
surfaces
fibered
over
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold
with
superdiffeomorphism
symmetric
complex-structure.

are
exactly-soluble.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Higgs.
