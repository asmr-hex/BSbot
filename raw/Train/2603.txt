Wheeler-De
Witt
equation
and
AdS/CFT
correspondence
\\
The
radial
Wheeler--De
Witt
equation
on
the
asymptotically
AdS
spacetime
proposed
in
[9]
has
as
its
semiclassical
solution
the
wave
function
that
asymptotically
satisfies
the
conformal
Ward
identity,
exemplifying
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence.
In
this
paper
we
show
that
this
results
holds
also
in
the
case
of
a
complete
quantum
solution
of
the
radial
Wheeler--De
Witt
equation.
It
turns
out
that
if
the
wavefunction
is
expanded
in
the
parameter
$\rho$
with
$\rho\rightarrow0$
defines
the
asymptotic
boundary
of
the
spacetime,
the
quantum
loop
corrections
to
the
semiclassical
wave
are
of
subleading
order.
