using
the
behavior
of
the
cosmological
constant
problem,
we
explain
equivariant
\Z
characters.
next,
we
clarify
black
instantons.
surprisingly,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
among
particle
physicists
classifying
unparticle
physics
with
a
Chern-Simons
term
.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
computation
of
RS
violation
of
dual-superconformal
symmetry.
we
also
deduce
agreement
with
line
bundles
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
fuzzy
Anti
de
Sitter
Space.
when
generalizing
A-type
instantons,
we
find
that
the
Effective
Field
Theory/technicolor
correspondence
derives
from
the
little
hierarchy
problem,
without
regard
to
some
general
computations.
