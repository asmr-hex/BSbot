Nontrivial
Quantization
of
$Ï†^4_n$,
$n\ge2$
\\
Conventional
quantization
of
covariant
scalar
field
models
$\phi^4_n$,
for
spacetime
dimensions
$n\ge5$
are
trivial,
and
this
may
also
be
true
for
$n=4$
as
well.
However,
an
alternative
${\cal
O}(\hbar)$
counterterm
leads
to
nontrivial
results
for
all
$n\ge4$,
and
provides
a
different
quantization
for
$n=2,3$
as
well.
In
this
article
we
determine
the
counterterm
that
provides
these
desirable
properties
as
simply
and
directly
as
possible.
The
same
counterterm
also
resolves
models
such
as
$\phi^p_n$
for
all
even
$p$,
including
those
where
$p&gt;2n/(n-2)$,
which
are
traditionally
regarded
as
nonrenormalizable.
