This
thesis
includes
several
original
results.
All
of
them
are
already
published
or
submitted
for
publication.
I
present
here
the
short
summary
of
main
results:
The
ultraviolet
singular
structure
of
the
bulk-to-bulk
propagators
for
higher
spin
gauge
fields
in
AdS4
space
is
analyzed
in
details.
One
loop
mass
renormalization
is
studied
on
a
simple
example.
The
conformal
invariant
Lagrangian
with
the
k-th
power
of
Laplacian
for
the
hierarchy
of
conformally
coupled
scalars
with
increasing
scaling
dimensions
connected
with
the
k-th
Euler
density
is
rederived
using
the
Fefferman-Graham
ambient
space
approach.
The
corresponding
gauged
ambient
metric,
Fefferman-
Graham
expansion
and
extended
Penrose-Brown-Henneaux
transformations
are
proposed
and
analyzed.
Linearized
gauge
invariant
interactions
of
scalar
and
general
higher
even
spin
fields
in
the
AdSD
space
are
obtained.
A
generalized
Weyl
transformation
is
proposed
and
the
corresponding
Weyl
invariant
action
for
cubic
coupling
of
a
scalar
to
a
spin
\ell
field
is
constructed.
Using
Noether's
procedure
several
cubic
interactions
between
different
HS
gauge
fields
are
derived,
including
cubic
selfinteraction
of
even
spin
gauge
fields
in
a
flat
background.
Then
the
main
result
-
the
complete
off-shell
gauge
invariant
Lagrangian
for
the
trilinear
interactions
of
Higher
Spin
Fields
with
arbitrary
spins
s1,
s2,
s3
in
a
flat
background
is
presented.
All
possibilities
with
different
numbers
of
derivatives
are
discussed.
Restrictions
on
the
number
of
derivatives
are
obtained.
For
any
possible
number
of
derivatives
this
interaction
is
uniquely
fixed
by
gauge
invariance
up
to
partial
integration
and
field
redefinition.
Finally
an
off-shell
generating
function
for
all
cubic
interactions
of
Higher
Spin
gauge
fields
is
presented.
It
is
written
in
a
compact
way,
and
turns
out
to
have
a
remarkable
structure.
