Compact
boson
stars
in
K
field
theories
\\
We
study
a
scalar
field
theory
with
a
non-standard
kinetic
term
minimally
coupled
to
gravity.
We
establish
the
existence
of
compact
boson
stars,
that
is,
static
solutions
with
compact
support
of
the
full
system
with
self-gravitation
taken
into
account.
Concretely,
there
exist
two
types
of
solutions,
namely
compact
balls
on
the
one
hand,
and
compact
shells
on
the
other
hand.
The
compact
balls
have
a
naked
singularity
at
the
center.
The
inner
boundary
of
the
compact
shells
is
singular,
as
well,
but
it
is,
at
the
same
time,
a
Killing
horizon.
These
singular,
compact
shells
therefore
resemble
black
holes.
