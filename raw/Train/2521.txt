Non-Relativistic
Holography
--
A
Group-Theoretical
Perspective
\\
We
give
a
review
of
some
group-theoretical
results
related
to
non-relativistic
holography.
Our
main
playgrounds
are
the
Schr\"odinger
equation
and
the
Schr\"odinger
algebra.
We
first
recall
the
interpretation
of
non-relativistic
holography
as
equivalence
between
representations
of
the
Schr\"odinger
algebra
describing
bulk
fields
and
boundary
fields.
One
important
result
is
the
explicit
construction
of
the
boundary-to-bulk
operators
in
the
framework
of
representation
theory,
and
that
these
operators
and
the
bulk-to-boundary
operators
are
intertwining
operators.
Further,
we
recall
the
fact
that
there
is
a
hierarchy
of
equations
on
the
boundary,
invariant
w.r.t.
Schr\"odinger
algebra.
We
also
review
the
explicit
construction
of
an
analogous
hierarchy
of
invariant
equations
in
the
bulk,
and
that
the
two
hierarchies
are
equivalent
via
the
bulk-to-boundary
intertwining
operators.
The
derivation
of
these
hierarchies
uses
a
mechanism
introduced
first
for
semi-simple
Lie
groups
and
adapted
to
the
non-semisimple
Schr\"odinger
algebra.
These
requires
development
of
the
representation
theory
of
the
Schr\"odinger
algebra
which
is
reviewed
in
some
detail.
We
also
recall
the
$q$-deformation
of
the
Schr\"odinger
algebra.
Finally,
the
realization
of
the
Schr\"odinger
algebra
via
difference
operators
is
reviewed.
