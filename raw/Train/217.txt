\\
Vacuum
fluctuations
related
a
massless
conformally
coupled
scalar
field
in
Friedman-Robertson-Walker-Lemaitre
(FRWL)
space-times
are
investigated.
Point-slitting
regularization
is
used
and
a
specific
renormalization
proposal
is
discussed.
Applications
to
generic
black
holes
and
FRWL
form
of
the
de
Sitter
space-time
are
presented.
