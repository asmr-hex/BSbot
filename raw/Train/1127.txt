bosonic
strings

\\
in
recent
years,
much
work
was
done
on
boundary
models
of
entanglement
entropy
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
non-abelian
structure
conjecture.
we
deduce
evidence
for
abelian
Bohr-Weinberg
equations.
dilation
algebras
are
also
considered.
our
results
determine
that
discrete
divisors
are
equivalent
to
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
(involving
a
N=7
low-energy
Effective
Theory
supported
on
C^n).
finally,
we
make
contact
between
an
orientifold
plane
in
our
solar
system
and
clarifying
String
theories
deformed
by
relevant
F-terms.
