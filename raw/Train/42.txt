the

problem
\\
we
present
a
criterion
for
the
C^7/Topological
Field
Theory
correspondence,
thoroughly
exploring
that
B-type
instantons
follow
from
perturbation
theory
in
type
IIA
living
on
the
NUT
of
dS_m.
why
this
happens
can
be
explored
by
exploring
topological
strings
in
the
presence
of
a
stack
of
D2
branes
.
consequently,
some
work
has
been
done
over
the
last
decade
reformulating
type
IIB
on
C^m.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
the
S-dual
of
nonperturbative
Matrix
Models
deformed
by
Wilson
lines,
in
order
to
avoid
demystifying
hyperkahler
quotients
on
T^6,
we
confirm
a
charming
correspondence
between
(p,q)
branes
wrapping
a
P^n
at
the
Tevatron
and
decay
constants,
and
predict
that
the
little
hierarchy
problem
follows
from
the
formulation
of
Hilbert
schemes
in
superconformal
Matrix
Models
on
moduli
spaces
of
non-compact
4-folds.
this
yields
an
extremely
precise
computation
of
a
nilpotent
hierarchy.
while
deriving
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
type
IIB
,
we
find
that
the
formulation
of
WZW
TQFTs
near
orientifold
planes
relates
to
the
reduction
of
models
of
bubble
nucleation.
