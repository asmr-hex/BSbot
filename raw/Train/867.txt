Calculable
membrane
theory
\\
The
key
to
membrane
theory
is
to
enlarge
the
diffeomorphism
group
until
4D
gravity
becomes
almost
topological.
Just
one
ghost
survives
and
its
central
charges
can
cancel
against
matter.
A
simple
bosonic
membrane
emerges,
but
its
flat
D
=
28
target
space
is
unstable.
Adding
supersymmetry
ought
to
give
calculable
(2,2)
membranes
in
12
target
dimensions,
but
(2,1)
membranes
won't
work.
