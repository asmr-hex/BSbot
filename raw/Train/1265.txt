\\
In
this
note
we
calculate
elliptic
genus
in
various
examples
of
twisted
chiral
de
Rham
complex
on
two
dimensional
toric
compact
manifolds
and
Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces
in
toric
manifolds.
At
first
the
elliptic
genus
is
calculated
for
the
line
bundle
twisted
chiral
de
Rham
complex
on
a
compact
smooth
toric
manifold
and
K3
hypersurface
in
\mathbb{P}^{3}
.
Then
we
twist
chiral
de
Rham
complex
by
sheaves
localized
on
positive
codimension
submanifolds
in
\mathbb{P}^{2}
and
calculate
in
each
case
the
elliptic
genus.
In
the
last
example
the
elliptic
genus
of
chiral
de
Rham
complex
on
\mathbb{P}^{2}
twisted
by
SL(N)
vector
bundle
with
instanton
number
k
is
calculated.
In
all
cases
considered
we
find
the
infinite
tower
of
open
string
oscillator
contributions
of
the
corresponding
bound
state
of
D-branes
and
identify
directly
the
open
string
boundary
conditions
and
D-brane
charges.
