We
derive
the
detailed
balance
condition
as
a
solution
to
the
Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
in
the
Horava-Lifshitz
gravity.
This
result
leads
us
to
propose
the
existence
of
the
d-dimensional
quantum
field
theory
on
the
future
boundary
of
the
(d+1)-dimensional
Horava-Lifshitz
gravity
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
holographic
renormalization
group.
We
also
obtain
a
Ricci
flow
equation
of
the
boundary
theory
as
the
holographic
RG
flow,
which
is
the
Hamilton
equation
in
the
bulk
gravity,
by
tuning
parameters
in
the
theory.
