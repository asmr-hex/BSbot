Off-shell
Amplitudes
in
Superstring
Theory
\\
Computing
the
renormalized
masses
and
S-matrix
elements
in
string
theory,
involving
states
whose
masses
are
not
protected
from
quantum
corrections,
requires
defining
off-shell
amplitude
with
certain
factorization
properties.
While
in
the
bosonic
string
theory
one
can
in
principle
construct
such
an
amplitude
from
string
field
theory,
there
is
no
fully
consistent
field
theory
for
superstring
and
heterotic
string
theory.
In
this
paper
we
give
a
practical
construction
of
off-shell
amplitudes
satisfying
the
desired
factorization
property
using
the
formalism
of
picture
changing
operators.
We
describe
a
systematic
procedure
for
dealing
with
the
spurious
singularities
of
the
integration
measure
that
we
encounter
when
the
supermoduli
space
is
not
holomorphically
projected.
This
procedure
is
also
useful
for
computing
on-shell
amplitudes,
as
we
demonstrate
by
computing
the
effect
of
Fayet-Iliopoulos
D-terms
in
four
dimensional
heterotic
string
theory
compactifications
using
this
formalism.
