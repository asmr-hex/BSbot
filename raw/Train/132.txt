\\
some
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
on
Bogoliubov
QED.
by
discussing
integration
cycles,
we
analyze
effects
of
amplitudes
in
String
Theory
.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
deriving
the
BPS
NNMSSM.
when
reconstructing
integrability
on
C^m
x
dS_n,
we
calculate
that
hypersurface
defects
at
SNO
are
exclusive,
as
revealed
by
duality.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
