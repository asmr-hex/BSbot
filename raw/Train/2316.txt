Solitons
as
Probes
of
the
Structure
of
Holographic
Superfluids
\\
Detailed
features
of
solitons
in
holographic
superfluids
are
discussed.
Using
solitons
as
probes,
we
study
the
behavior
of
holographic
superfluids
by
varying
the
scaling
dimension
of
the
condensing
operator,
and
build
a
comparison
to
the
BEC-BCS
comparison
phenomena.
Further
evidence
for
this
analogy
is
provided
by
the
behavior
of
solitons'
length
scales
as
well
as
by
the
superfluid
critical
velocity.
