3d
TQFT
from
6d
SCFT
\\
We
study
the
six-dimensional
(2,0)
superconformal
field
theory
on
S^1
x
S^2
x
M
via
compactification
to
five
dimensions,
where
M
is
a
three-manifold.
Twisted
along
M,
the
five-dimensional
theory
has
a
half
of
N
=
(2,2)
supersymmetry
on
S^2,
the
other
half
being
broken
by
a
superpotential.
We
show
that
in
the
limit
where
M
is
infinitely
large,
the
twisted
theory
reduces
to
a
three-dimensional
topological
quantum
field
theory
which
is
closely
related
to
Chern-Simons
theory
for
the
complexified
gauge
group.
