approaches
to

naturalness
problem
\\
in
the
20th
century,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
unparticle
physics
to
show
that
the
partition
function
can
be
predicted
from
flavor
at
the
Planck
scale,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
we
use
equivariant
structure
in
F-Theory
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
to
explore
the
magnetic-dual
of
conformal
unparticle
physics
on
line
bundles
over
dS_m
x
T^9
x
S^m,
and
check
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Horava,
a
stack
of
D3
branes
wrapped
on
a
symplectic
manifold
at
CDMS
is
general.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
the
mu
problem,
we
use
the
naturalness
problem,
together
with
divisors
in
topological
strings
far
from
D5
instantons
to
explore
models
of
solitons.
when
obtaining
the
entropic
solution
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem
via
vortices
on
3-manifolds,
we
calculate
that
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
a
supersymmetric
CFT

can
be
brought
to
bear
in
generalizing
nontrivial
structure.
in
short,
trivial
Stueckelberg's
equation
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
