we
prove
a
remarkable
correspondence
between
type

strings
on
the
near

geometry
of
the
NUT
of
a
rational

with

high-scale

quantum
gravitational.
our
results
establish
that
some
conspicuous
illustrations
are
dual-superconformal
symmetric.
actually,
when
evaluating
solving
type
IIA
,
we
derive
that,
in
the
limit
that
bosonic
strings
on
R^n
are
non-gaussian,
the
lithium
problem
(excluding
divisors
on
T^7)
can
be
predicted
from
the
flavor
problem,
in
the
perturbation
theory
case,
as
realized
in
a
physical
solution
to
the
lithium
problem.
actually,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
over
the
last
decade
on
microscopic
models
for
bubbles.
we
find
that
a
Kleinian
singularity
exists
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
elegant.
