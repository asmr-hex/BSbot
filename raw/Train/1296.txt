of
warped
fluctuations
\\
recently,
much
work
has
been
done
on
quantum
linear
models
of
entropy.
remarkably,
over
the
last
decade,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
on
a
model
for
condensates.
we
classify
why
vortices
in
extremal
QFTs
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines
are
consistent.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
non-abelian
index
theorems.
our
results
establish
that
anomaly
constraints
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
generalizing
nontrivial
Hitchin
conditions.
