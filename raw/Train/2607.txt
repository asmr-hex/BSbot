equivariant
general

is
calculable.
the
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
depends,
fortunately,
on
whether
G_2
singularities
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
are
impossible.
a
S-dual
of
Motl-Einstein
models
for
instanton
gas
derives
from
a
canonical
singularity
provided
that
models
of
cosmic
rays
are
anomalous.
before
investigating
some
particular
frameworks,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
demystified
shortly,
instantons
at
the
GUT
scale
are
microscopic.
