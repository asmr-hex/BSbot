Relative
information
at
the
foundation
of
physics
\\
Shannon's
notion
of
relative
information
between
two
physical
systems
can
function
as
foundation
for
statistical
mechanics
and
quantum
mechanics,
without
referring
to
subjectivism
or
idealism.
It
can
also
represent
a
key
missing
element
in
the
foundation
of
the
naturalistic
picture
of
the
world,
providing
the
conceptual
tool
for
dealing
with
its
apparent
limitations.
I
comment
on
the
relation
between
these
ideas
and
Democritus.
