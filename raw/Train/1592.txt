Realization
of
Instantons
\\
In
Euclidean
path
integrals,
quantum
mechanical
tunneling
amplitudes
are
associated
with
instanton
configurations.
We
explain
how
tunneling
amplitudes
are
encoded
in
real-time
Feynman
path
integrals.
The
essential
steps
are
borrowed
from
Picard-Lefschetz
theory
and
resurgence
theory.
