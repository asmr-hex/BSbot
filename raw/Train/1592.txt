The
measure
problem
of
cosmology
is
how
to
obtain
normalized
probabilities
of
observations
from
the
quantum
state
of
the
universe.
This
is
particularly
a
problem
when
eternal
inflation
leads
to
a
universe
of
unbounded
size
so
that
there
are
apparently
infinitely
many
realizations
or
occurrences
of
observations
of
each
of
many
different
kinds
or
types,
making
the
ratios
ambiguous.
There
is
also
the
danger
of
domination
by
Boltzmann
Brains.
Here
two
new
Spacetime
Average
Density
(SAD)
measures
are
proposed,
Maximal
Average
Density
(MAD)
and
Biased
Average
Density
(BAD),
for
getting
a
finite
number
of
observation
occurrences
by
using
properties
of
the
Spacetime
Average
Density
(SAD)
of
observation
occurrences
to
restrict
to
finite
regions
of
spacetimes
that
have
a
preferred
beginning
or
bounce
hypersurface.
These
measures
avoid
Boltzmann
brain
domination
and
appear
to
give
results
consistent
with
other
observations
that
are
problematic
for
other
widely
used
measures,
such
as
the
observation
of
a
positive
cosmological
constant.
