Quantum
Corrections
in
Galileons
from
Matter
Loops
\\
Galileon
interactions
represent
a
class
of
effective
field
theories
that
have
received
much
attention
since
their
inception.
They
can
be
treated
in
their
own
right
as
scalar
field
theories
with
a
specific
global
shift
and
Galilean
symmetry
or
as
a
descendant
of
a
more
fundamental
theory
like
massive
gravity.
It
is
well
known
that
the
Galileon
theories
are
stable
under
quantum
corrections
thanks
to
the
non-renormalization
theorem
which
is
not
due
to
the
symmetry.
We
consider
different
covariant
couplings
of
this
Galileon
scalar
field
with
the
matter
field:
the
conformal
coupling,
the
disformal
coupling
and
the
longitudinal
coupling.
We
compute
the
one-loop
quantum
corrections
to
the
Galileon
interactions
from
the
coupling
to
the
external
matter
fields.
In
all
the
considered
cases
of
covariant
couplings
we
show
that
the
terms
generated
by
one-loop
matter
corrections
not
only
renormalize
the
Galileon
interactions
but
also
give
rise
to
higher
order
derivative
ghost
interactions.
However,
the
renormalized
version
of
the
Galileon
interactions
as
well
as
the
new
interactions
come
at
a
scale
suppressed
by
the
original
classical
coupling
scale
and
hence
are
harmless
within
the
regime
of
validity
of
the
effective
field
theory.
