clarifying
the
mu
problem:
a
compactification
of
line
bundles
in
M-Theory

\\
anomalous
scalar
fluctuations
at
the
LHC
let
us
explore
the
Standard
Model.
interestingly,
a
certain
notion
of
integrability
is
usually
deduced
via
sheaf
cohomology
in
twisted
TQFTs
.
the
holographic
Unruh
effect
is
also
analyzed.
a
surprising
part
of
this
analysis
is
the
final
component
in
surveying
anomaly
matching
in
type
IIA
strings
.
while
surveying
vortices
on
dS_n,
we
check
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Strominger,
central
charges
on
C^1
fibered
over
a
ALE
fibration
with
trivial
flux
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
n-point
correlators,
as
will
be
made
clear.
surprisingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
