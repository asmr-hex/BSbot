We
revisit
the
computation
of
the
2-loop
correction
to
the
energy
of
a
folded
spinning
string
in
AdS_5
with
an
angular
momentum
J
in
S^5
in
the
scaling
limit
log
S,
J
&gt;&gt;1
with
J
/
log
S
fixed.
This
correction
gives
the
third
term
in
the
strong-coupling
expansion
of
the
generalized
scaling
function.
The
computation,
using
the
AdS
light-cone
gauge
approach
developed
in
our
previous
paper,
is
done
by
expanding
the
AdS_5
x
S^5
superstring
partition
function
near
the
generalized
null
cusp
world
surface
associated
to
the
spinning
string
solution.
The
result
corrects
and
extends
the
previous
conformal
gauge
result
of
