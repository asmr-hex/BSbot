Compactified
Reduction
from
Five
to
Four
Space-Time
Dimensions
of
the
Antisymmetric
Tensor
Field
\\
We
employ
a
Kaluza-Klein
dimensional
reduction
process
on
the
action
of
the
antisymmetric
tensor
field
in
five-dimensional
space-time.
The
result
is
a
joint
field
theory
of
four-dimensional
antisymmetric
and
vector
fields.
We
write
the
inhomogeneous
Euler-Lagrange
equations
and
homogeneous
Bianchi
identity
equations
for
the
four
dimensional
field
strengths.
In
these
equations
the
terms
that
couple
the
field
strengths
depend
on
their
variation
with
the
compactified
fifth
variable.
We
find
that
the
electric
charge
current
is
conserved,
but
in
general
the
source
current
of
the
antisymmetric
field
is
not.
The
action
also
displays
joint
gauge
invariance.
Observing
the
fields
in
a
particular
Lorentz
frame
leads
to
modified
Maxwell
and
antisymmetric
field
equations.
For
the
Maxwell
field
the
antisymmetric
field
strengths
lead
to
coupling
terms
that
represent
both
magnetic
charge
density
and
additional
induced
emf.
