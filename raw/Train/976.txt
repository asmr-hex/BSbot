Calabi-Yau
Geometries:
Algorithms,
Databases,
and
Physics
\\
With
a
bird's-eye
view,
we
survey
the
landscape
of
Calabi-Yau
threefolds,
compact
and
non-compact,
smooth
and
singular.
Emphasis
will
be
placed
on
the
algorithms
and
databases
which
have
been
established
over
the
years,
and
how
they
have
been
useful
in
the
interaction
between
the
physics
and
the
mathematics,
especially
in
string
and
gauge
theories.
A
skein
which
runs
through
this
review
will
be
algorithmic
and
computational
algebraic
geometry
and
how,
implementing
its
principles
on
powerful
computers
and
experimenting
with
the
vast
mathematical
data,
new
physics
can
be
learnt.
It
is
hoped
that
this
inter-disciplinary
glimpse
will
be
of
some
use
to
the
beginning
student.
