Twistor
relative
locality
\\
We
present
a
version
of
relative
locality
based
on
the
geometry
of
twistor
space.
This
can
also
be
thought
of
as
a
new
kind
of
deformation
of
twistor
theory
based
on
the
construction
of
a
bundle
of
twistor
spaces
over
momentum
space.
Locality
in
space-time
is
emergent
and
is
deformed
in
a
precise
way
when
a
connection
on
that
bundle
is
non-flat.
This
gives
a
precise
and
controlled
meaning
to
Penrose's
hypothesis
that
quantum
gravity
effects
will
deform
twistor
space
in
such
a
way
as
to
maintain
causality
and
relativistic
invariance
while
weakening
the
notion
that
interactions
take
place
at
points
in
spacetime.
