Coarse

I
review
some
of
the
concepts
at
the
crossroads
of
gravitational
thermodynamics,
holography
and
quantum
mechanics.
First,
the
origin
of
gravitational
thermodynamics
due
to
coarse
graining
of
quantum
information
is
exemplified
using
the
half-BPS
sector
of
${\cal
N}=4$
SYM
and
its
LLM
description
in
type
IIB
supergravity.
The
notion
of
black
holes
as
effective
geometries,
its
relation
to
the
fuzzball
programme
and
some
of
the
puzzles
raising
for
large
black
holes
are
discussed.
Second,
I
review
recent
progress
for
extremal
black
holes,
both
microscopically,
discussing
a
constituent
model
for
stationary
extremal
non-bps
black
holes,
and
semiclassically,
discussing
the
extremal
black
hole/CFT
conjecture.
The
latter
is
examined
from
the
AdS${}_3$/CFT${}_2$
perspective.
Third,
I
review
the
importance
of
the
holographic
principle
to
encode
non-local
gravity
features
allowing
us
to
relate
the
gravitational
physics
of
local
observers
with
thermodynamics
and
the
role
causality
plays
in
these
arguments
by
identifying
horizons
(screens)
as
diathermic
walls.
I
speculate
with
the
emergence
of
an
approximate
CFT
in
the
deep
IR
close
to
any
horizon
and
its
relation
with
an
effective
dynamical
description
of
the
degrees
of
freedom
living
on
these
holographic
screens.
