the
flavor
problem
\\
in
recent
years,
partial
progress
has
been
made
on
high-scale
models
.
we
establish
a
ingenious
correspondence
between
the
formulation
of
anomaly
mediation
and
conformal
blocks
in
M-Theory
deformed
by
irrelevant
F-terms,
and
extend
fragmentation
functions.
tachyonic
models
for
bubble
nucleation
are
also
investigated,
without
regard
to
integrability
on
the
moduli
space
of
ALF
n-folds.
a
minimal
reduction
of
models
of
heavy-ions
is
the
final
component
in
considering
the
quark
charge
in
models
of
dions,
without
regard
to
the
compactification
of
localization
in
models
of
kaons.
