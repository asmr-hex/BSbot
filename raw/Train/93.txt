Holographic
Renormalization
for
Fermions
in
Real
Time
\\
We
consider
the
real-time
holography
on
Anti-de-Sitter
(AdS)
and
more
generally
on
Lifshitz
spacetimes
for
spinorial
fields.
The
equation
of
motion
for
fermions
on
general
Lifshitz
space
is
derived.
Analytically
solvable
cases
are
identified.
On
AdS
space
we
derived
time-ordered,
time-reversed,
advanced
and
retarded
propagators
with
the
correct
i
\epsilon-insertions.
Using
the
Keldysh-Schwinger
contour
we
also
calculated
a
propagator
on
thermal
AdS.
For
massless
fermions
on
the
Lifshitz
spacetime
with
z=2
we
calculated
the
Euclidean
2-point
function
and
explored
the
structure
of
divergences
of
the
on-shell
action
for
general
values
of
z
and
mass
m.
The
covariant
counterterm
action
is
derived.
