Extremal
Surfaces
And
Entanglement
Entropy
\\
We
have
obtained
the
equation
of
the
extremal
hypersurface
by
considering
the
Jacobson-Myers
functional
and
computed
the
entanglement
entropy.
In
this
context,
we
show
that
the
higher
derivative
corrected
extremal
surfaces
can
not
penetrate
the
horizon.
Also,
we
have
studied
the
entanglement
temperature
and
entanglement
entropy
for
low
excited
states
for
such
higher
derivative
theories
when
the
entangling
region
is
of
the
strip
type.
