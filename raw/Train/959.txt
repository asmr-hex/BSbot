First
order
formalism
for
the
holographic
duals
of
defect
CFTs
\\
We
develop
a
first
order
formalism
for
constructing
gravitational
duals
of
conformal
defects
in
a
bottom
up
approach.
Similarly
as
for
the
flat
domain
walls
a
single
function
specifies
the
solution
completely.
Using
this
formalism
we
construct
several
novel
families
of
analytic
solutions
dual
to
conformal
interfaces
and
boundaries.
As
a
sample
application
we
study
the
boundary
OPE
and
entanglement
entropy
for
one
of
the
found
defects.
