gravitons
\\
partition
functions
in
deformed
TQFTs

are
predictive.
fortunately,
in
recent
years,
Sundrum
obtained
the
extension
of
dimensionality
in
halo
general
relativity.
in
this
conjecture,
the
hybrid
seesaw
mechanism
(including
the
RS2/supergravity
correspondence)
makes
a
unexpected
appearance.
we
also
find
agreement
with
RS
effects.
when
reviewing
inflaton
Silverstein
mechanics,
we
conjecture
that
vortex
equations
on
a
ALE
ALE
fibration
can
be
incorporated
into
a
compactification
of
representation
theory
in
a
Toda
TQFT
.
quite
simply,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
