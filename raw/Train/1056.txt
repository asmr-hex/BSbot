Time
boundary
terms
and
Dirac
constraints
\\
Time
boundary
terms
usually
added
to
action
principles
are
systematically
handled
in
the
framework
of
Dirac's
canonical
analysis.
The
procedure
begins
with
the
introduction
of
the
boundary
term
into
the
integral
Hamiltonian
action
and
then
the
resulting
action
is
interpreted
as
a
Lagrangian
one
to
which
Dirac's
method
is
applied.
Once
the
general
theory
is
developed,
the
current
procedure
is
implemented
and
illustrated
in
various
examples
which
are
originally
endowed
with
different
types
of
constraints.
