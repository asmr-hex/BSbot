\\
in
the
20th
century,
little
work
has
been
done
on
models
of
cosmic
rays.
consequently,
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
models
of
bubble
nucleation
has
opened
up
a
worldsheet
invariant
class
of
particle
models.
we
confirm
a
critical
correspondence
between
a
certain
notion
of
't
Hooft's
equation
and
an
orientifold
plane
at
SNO.
models
of
WIMPs
are
also
derived.
before
surveying
equations
of
topological
strings

in
hydrodynamics,
we
find
that,
by
superconformal
symmetry,
marginal
operators
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
linear
dilaton
background
with
discrete
H-flux
are
anomalous.
