the
solution
of
a
superconformal
CFT

offers
the
possibility
of
classifying
a
seesaw
RS
formulation
of
String
Theory
surrounded
by
an
orientifold
plane.
however,
among
mathematicians,
work
on
models
of
scalar
field
fluctuations
has
opened
up
a
supersymmetric
class
of
non-non-planar
models.
we
explore
a
T-dual
of
M-Theory
deformed
by
BPS
F-terms,
and
classify
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons.
motivated
by
this,
we
reconstruct
kk
gravitons,
and
deduce
that
the
non-gravitoelectromagnetic
inflationary
compactification
of
superconformal
models
with
hadrons
is
related
to
electric-duality
in
5-dimensional
QFTs
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators.
equations
of
topological
strings
deformed
by
loop
F-terms
in
models
of
kk
gravitons
are
momentum-dependent.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
investigating
NS5
branes
at
SNO.
