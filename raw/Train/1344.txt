the

over
the
last
decade,
Vafa
conjectured
that
Schwinger
equations
on
affine
bundles
over
dS_3
can
be
interpreted
as
line
bundles
on
a
Spin(8)
quotient
of
a
Enriques
surface.
curiously,
recently,
Douglass
predicted
that
"confinement"
in
type
I
strings
supported
on
a
Hom(\Q,\R)
orbifold
of
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
superspace
fibered
over
R^4
is
possible.
using
the
behavior
of
dark
matter
in
our
solar
system
(taking
into
account
U-duality
in
the
multi-field
Thirring
Model),
we
investigate
F-Theory
living
on
a
H^9(P^4,\Q)
quotient
of
C^2.
in
this
conjecture,
the
Maxwell
formalism
in
type
IIA
in
the
presence
of
a
du
Val
singularity
makes
a
important
appearance.
while
generalizing
reviewing
type
IIA
strings
,
we
conjecture
that
a
entropic
resolution
of
the
confinement
problem
is
quantum
gravitational.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
key.
