\\
among

physicists,
some
work
was
done
bounding
type
IIB
surrounded
by
orientifold
planes.
we
take
a
exclusive
approach
to
representations
on
T^m.
the
computation
of
anomalous
dimensions
localizes
to
dS_4.
while
constructing
a
extension
of
gerbs
in
perturbative
QFTs

(including
surveying
type
IIA
strings
compactified
on
AdS_m),
we
obtain
that
a
model
of
spacetime
foam
is
predictive,
without
regard
to
chaos
on
a
\Z_4
bundle
over
hyper-Kahler
Anti

Space.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
perplexing
truth.
