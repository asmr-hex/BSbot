Scalar
and
fermion
contributions
to
the
vacuum
energy
\\
I
consider
a
theory
of
a
real
scalar
and
a
fermion
field,
with
a
Yukawa
interaction
and
a
potential
term
that
admits
two
degenerate
minima
at
the
tree
level.
I
calculate
the
quantum
vacuum
energy
difference
between
these
two
vacua
and
I
find
a
finite,
non-zero
result,
with
scalar
and
fermion
contributions
whose
origin
and
physical
significance
I
discuss.
