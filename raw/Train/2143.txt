Supersymmetry
Breaking
and
the
Cosmological
Constant
\\
I
review
three
attempts
to
explain
the
small
value
of
the
cosmological
constant,
and
their
connection
to
SUSY
breaking.
They
are
The
String
Landscape,
Supersymmetric
Large
Extra
Dimensions
(SLED),
and
the
Holographic
Space-time
Formalism
invented
by
Fischler
and
myself.
