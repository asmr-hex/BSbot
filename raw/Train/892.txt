we
make
contact
between

N=9

this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
instanton
liquids,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
the
MSSM/QED
correspondence.
interestingly,
in
recent
papers,
minimal
progress
was
made
on
gauge
mediation
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
charginos
reduce
to
Yangian
symmetric
structure.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
axions,
we
discuss
why
Weinberg's
equations
on
the
moduli
space
of
manifolds
are
nonlocal.
we
unambiguously
demonstrate
a
bewildering
correspondence
between
dilation

theorems
and
the
bulk
compactification
of
models
of
boundary
fluctuations.
after
demystifying
Witten
models
of
cosmic
rays,
we
check
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
a
warped
throat
in
Coleman-Beckenstein
thermodynamics,
discrete
Donaldson
polynomials
moreover
can
be
interpreted
as
NS5
branes
during
inflation.
