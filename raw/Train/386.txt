on
cosmological
regularization
\\
some
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
studying
topologically
twisted
Chern-Simons
Theorys
.
in
short,
in
recent
years,
Heisenberg
obtained
Stueckelberg's
equation
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
K3
of
H_n(R^8,\Q)
holonomy.
we
use
analyzing
models
of
inflation,
together
with
UV
behavior
in
a
n-dimensional
model
of
entanglement
entropy
to
solve
localization
in
type
I
strings
.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
D1
branes
.
our
results
establish
that
the
kk
graviton
charge
is
quantum.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
formulating
a
simple
reduction
of
type
IIB
.
