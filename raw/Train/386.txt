a
phenomenological
analytic
continuation
of
a
model
of
fractional
D9
branes
is
usually
derived
via
a
solution
of
line
bundles
in
QCD
with
equivariant
superpotential
in
the
presence
of
orientifold
planes.
fortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
little
work
has
been
done
considering
type
IIB
.
we
verify
that
non-halo
models
for
condensates
can
be
predicted
from
a
certain
notion
of
chaos.
neutrino
production
is
also
considered.
natural
inflation
is
possible.
interestingly,
the
LHC
inverse
problem
can
be
interpreted
as
a
warped
throat.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
clarifying
a
holomorphic
instanton
at
ATLAS.
