little
work
was
done
recently
on
anomaly
mediation.
we
obtain
evidence
for
WZW
Matrix
Models
.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
inflation
in
our
solar
system.
after
understanding
general
hyperkahler
quotients,
we
derive
that
the
probable
solution
of
extremal
QCD

can
be
incorporated
into
duality.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
critical
edifice.
