On
the
consistent
interactions
in
D=11
among
a
graviton,
a
massless
gravitino
and
a
three-form
\\
The
couplings
that
can
be
introduced
between
a
massless
Rarita-Schwinger
field,
a
Pauli-Fierz
field
and
an
Abelian
three-form
gauge
field
in
eleven
spacetime
dimensions
are
analyzed
in
the
context
of
the
deformation
of
the
solution
of
the
master
equation.
