The
classifying
algebra
for
defects
\\
We
demonstrate
that
topological
defects
in
a
rational
conformal
field
theory
can
be
described
by
a
classifying
algebra
for
defects
-
a
finite-dimensional
semisimple
unital
commutative
associative
algebra
whose
irreducible
representations
give
the
defect
transmission
coefficients.
We
show
in
particular
that
the
structure
constants
of
the
classifying
algebra
are
traces
of
operators
on
spaces
of
conformal
blocks
and
that
the
defect
transmission
coefficients
determine
the
defect
partition
functions.
