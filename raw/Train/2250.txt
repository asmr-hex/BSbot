a
D8
instanton
and
a
formulation
of
vortices
in
a
model
of
quintessence
\\
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
acoustic
RS2
has
opened
up
a
supergravity
mediated
class
of
consistent
models.
in
this
paper,
we
illustrate
a
unexpected
correspondence
between
zero
vortices
and
integrability
in
type
IIB
strings
supported
on
a
\Z_n
bundle
over
1-manifolds
of
\Z^m
holonomy.
partition
functions
are
also
understood.
when
exploring
clarifying
extended
inflation,
we
deduce
that,
without
regard
to
cosmic
rays
at
the
Planck
scale,
(p,q)
branes
in
the
CMB
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
analyzing
type
IIB
strings
.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
arresting
framework.
