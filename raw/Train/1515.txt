Relative
entropy
in
higher
spin
holography
\\
We
examine
relative
entropy
in
the
context
of
the
higher-spin/CFT
duality.
We
consider
3d
bulk
configurations
in
higher
spin
gravity
which
are
dual
to
low
and
high
temperature
states
of
a
CFT
with
W-algebra
symmetries
in
presence
of
a
chemical
potential
for
a
higher
spin
current.
The
relative
entropy
between
these
states
is
then
evaluated
using
the
Wilson
line
functional
for
holographic
entanglement
entropy.
In
the
limit
of
small
entangling
intervals,
the
relative
entropy
should
vanish
for
a
generic
quantum
system.
We
confirm
this
behaviour
by
showing
that
the
difference
in
the
modular
Hamiltonian
between
the
states
matches
with
the
difference
in
the
entanglement
entropy
in
the
short-distance
regime.
Additionally,
we
compute
the
relative
entropy
between
states
corresponding
to
smooth
solutions
in
the
SL(2,Z)
family.
