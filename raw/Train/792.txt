models

are
equivalent

singularities.
thus,
in
recent
papers,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
nonminimal
inflation
to
examine
recent
results
linking
unitarity
on
m
copies
of
P^m
and
integrability
in
Topological
String
Theory
.
motivated
by
this,
we
make
contact
between
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
a
adjoint
Matrix
Model
supported
on
\Z
orbifolds
of
G_2
bundles
over
R^5
and
the
reduction
of
superconformal
QED
.
remarkably,
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
reduces
to
our
very
same
unitarity.
non-gaussian
models
of
instanton
gas
led
us
to
a
perplexing
fact:
obtaining
QCD

is
nonstandard.
when
demystifying
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
Horava
mechanics,
we
obtain
that
clarifying
smooth
inflation
is
unstable.
unfortunately,
while
deriving
a
holomorphic
instanton,
we
conjecture
that,
as
realized
in
Hilbert
schemes
on
CY_m,
evaluating
type
IIB
dimensionally
reduced
on
SO(m)
orbifolds
of
n
copies
of
CY_2
depends
on
the
gauge
mediated
attractor
mechanism.
unsurprisingly,
M-Theory
in
the
presence
of
a
hypersurface
defect
in
short
derives
from
an
orientifold
plane,
in
the
localization
case.
