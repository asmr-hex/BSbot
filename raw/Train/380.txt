Analytic
Coleman-De
Luccia
Geometries
\\
We
present
the
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
for
a
Euclidean
scale
factor
to
be
a
solution
of
the
Coleman-De
Luccia
equations
for
some
analytic
potential
$V(\phi)$,
with
a
Lorentzian
continuation
describing
the
growth
of
a
bubble
of
lower-energy
vacuum
surrounded
by
higher-energy
vacuum.
We
then
give
a
set
of
explicit
examples
that
satisfy
the
conditions
and
thus
are
closed-form
analytic
examples
of
Coleman-De
Luccia
geometries.
