CP
violation
in
the
models
of
fermion
localization
on
a
domain
wall
(brane)
\\
A
brief
survey
of
fermion
localization
mechanism
on
a
domain
wall
("thick
brane")
generated
by
a
topologically
nontrivial
vacuum
configuration
of
scalar
fields
is
given.
The
extension
of
scalar
fields
interaction
with
fermions
which
supplies
fermions
with
an
axial
mass
is
proposed.
For
several
flavors
and
generations
of
fermions
this
extension
can
entail
the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix
of
the
Standard
Model.
As
well
the
model
with
two
scalar
doublets
which
provide
a
supplementary
CP
violation
mechanism
is
considered.
