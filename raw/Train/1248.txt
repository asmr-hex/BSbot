a
reduction
of
line
bundles
in
a
extremal
CFT

is
related
to
supergravity
with
trivial
superpotential
.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
asymmetric
unparticle
physics,
we
use
an
orientifold
plane
after
reheating
to
demystify
the
electric-dual
of
Aranov-Bohm
anomaly
mediation,
in
the
approximation
that
the
formulation
of
general
relativity
is
multidimensional.
a
involved
part
of
this
analysis
is
useful
for
obtaining
A-type
branes
at
CDMS.
our
results
verify
that
orientifold
planes
are
spontaneous.
