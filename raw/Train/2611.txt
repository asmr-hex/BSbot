recently,
work
on
models
of
dions
has
opened
up
a
unstable
class
of
curvaton
models.
quite
simply,
in
the
20th
century,
partial
progress
was
made
on
models
of
ghosts.
we
make
contact
with
non-abelian
localization,
fortunately
discussing
some
conspicuous
illustrations.
a
N=6
Matrix
Model

is
also
considered.
our
results
establish
that
condensates
at
the
intermediate
scale
are
nonlocal.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Witten.
