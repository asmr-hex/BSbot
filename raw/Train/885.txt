Entropy
current
and
equilibrium
partition
function
in
fluid
dynamics
\\
Existence
of
an
entropy
current
with
non-negative
divergence
puts
a
lot
of
constraints
on
the
transport
coefficients
of
a
fluid,
so
does
the
existence
of
equilibrium.
In
all
the
cases
we
have
studied
so
far
we
have
seen
an
overlap
between
these
two
sets
of
constraints.
In
this
note
we
shall
try
to
explore
the
reason
for
such
an
overlap.
We
shall
also
see
how
a
part
of
the
entropy
current
could
be
determined
from
the
equilibrium
partition
function.
