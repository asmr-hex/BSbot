Deep
Inelastic
Scattering
in
Conformal
QCD
\\
We
consider
the
Regge
limit
of
a
CFT
correlation
function
of
two
vector
and
two
scalar
operators,
as
appropriate
to
study
small-x
deep
inelastic
scattering
in
N=4
SYM
or
in
QCD
assuming
approximate
conformal
symmetry.
After
clarifying
the
nature
of
the
Regge
limit
for
a
CFT
correlator,
we
use
its
conformal
partial
wave
expansion
to
obtain
an
impact
parameter
representation
encoding
the
exchange
of
a
spin
j
Reggeon
for
any
value
of
the
coupling
constant.
The
CFT
impact
parameter
space
is
the
three-dimensional
hyperbolic
space
H3,
which
is
the
impact
parameter
space
for
high
energy
scattering
in
the
dual
AdS
space.
We
determine
the
small-x
structure
functions
associated
to
the
exchange
of
a
Reggeon.
We
discuss
unitarization
from
the
point
of
view
of
scattering
in
AdS
and
comment
on
the
validity
of
the
eikonal
approximation.
