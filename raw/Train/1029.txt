Causal
Structure
and
Birefringence
in
Nonlinear
Electrodynamics
\\
We
investigate
the
causal
structure
of
general
nonlinear
electrodynamics
and
determine
which
Lagrangians
generate
an
effective
metric
conformal
to
Minkowski.
We
also
proof
that
there
is
only
one
analytic
nonlinear
electrodynamics
presenting
no
birefringence.
