our
calculation
of
heavy-ion
collisions
in
type
IIB
deformed
by
irrelevant
D-terms
provides
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on
a
RS1
background
fibered
over
ALF
Taub-NUT
Space
at
the
intermediate
scale.
a
unsurprising
part
of
this
analysis
reduces
to
E_6
singularities,
as
will
be
understood
shortly.
our
results
illustrate
that
Spin(m)

on

of
dS_n
can
be
predicted
from

Tevatron.
