Some
Aspects
on
Non-commutative
Theories
with
a
compactified
Extra-Dimension
\\
We
study
some
aspects
when
one
consider
the
existence
of
one
extra-dimension
in
addition
to
a
non-commutative
space-time.
We
present
here
two
different
examples,
where
the
first
one
provides
a
scenario
were
it
is
possible
to
relate
the
variations
on
the
compactification
radius
$L$
and
the
non-commutative
parameter
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$,
recovering
the
usual
Minkowski
$(3+1)D$
metric
and,
in
the
other
one,
we
can
set
a
simple
relationship
between
this
radius
and
$\theta$,
the
non-commutative
parameter,
for
the
gravitational
potential
between
a
point
particle
and
a
straight
cosmic
string
in
$(2+1)D$.
