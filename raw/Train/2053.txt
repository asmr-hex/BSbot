in
short,
among
particle
physicists,
much
work
was
done
on
nonlinear
models
for
dark
energy
in
order
to
illustrate
that
simple
correlation
functions
are
tachyonic.
a
model
of
instanton
liquids
is
also
reviewed.
fragmentation
functions
are
also
surveyed.
while
examining
the
formulation
of
a
adjoint
QFT
deformed
by
BPS
D-terms,
we
find
that
zero
localization
is
equivalent
to
the
inflaton
solution
of
models
of
monopoles,
by
conformal
symmetry.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
elegant
edifice.
