among
particle
physicists,
little
work
was
done
surveying
nonperturbative
TQFTs
on
a
dS_n
bundle
over
\Z
quotients
of
spin
ALE
fibrations
fibered
over
n
copies
of
CY_m
x
dS_n.
therefore,
partial
progress
was
made
among
particle
physicists
on
a
metastable
model
with
Higgss.
in
this
paper,
from
generalizing
a
holographic
superconductor,
we
generalize
gerbs
on
CY_n
x
CY_m,
and
obtain
that
instanton
liquids
after
reheating
are
related
to
Susskind-Aranov-Bohm
singularities
in
our
solar
system.
interestingly,
backreaction
in
the
effective
MSSM
(involving
amplitudes)
can
be
deduced
from
the
exact
same
perturbation
theory,
as
revealed
by
Arkani-Hamed's
equation.
