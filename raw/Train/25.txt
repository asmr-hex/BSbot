Matrix
Model
and
Elliptic
Curve
\\
Solution
to
the
reduced
matrix
model
of
IKKT
type
is
studied
with
non-zero
fermion
fields.
A
suggestion
is
made
that
our
universe
is
made
of
rational
numbers
rather
than
being
a
continuum.
To
substantiate
this
proposal,
the
reduced
Yang-Mills
equation
is
written
in
the
form
of
an
elliptic
curve.
The
normalization
of
the
solution
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
Weierstrass
function
generically
or
in
terms
of
the
Dedekind
function
in
the
case
of
3-brane.
A
way
to
define
the
gravitational
field
in
the
matrix
model
is
proposed
with
some
new
interpretation
of
the
cosmological
constant.
The
(first)
quantization
of
the
system
is
done
within
the
framework
of
non-commutative
geometry.
