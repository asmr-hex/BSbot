Electrostatic
self-force
of
a
point
charge
in
non
rotating
BTZ
geometries
\\
In
the
present
paper
the
electrostatic
of
charges
in
non
rotating
BTZ
black
holes
and
wormholes
is
studied.
The
particularities
of
the
geometry
makes
the
analysis
considerable
more
complicated
than
usual
electrostatic
in
a
flat
geometry.
First,
these
space
times
are
not
asymptotically
flat
but
instead
asymptotically
AdS.
In
addition,
the
relative
distance
d(r,r+1)
between
two
particles
located
at
a
radius
r
and
r+1
in
the
geometry
tends
to
zero
when
r
take
large
values.
This
behavior,
which
is
radically
different
in
a
flat
geometry,
changes
the
analysis
of
the
asymptotic
conditions
for
the
electrostatic
field.
These
subtleties
are
carefully
analyzed
in
the
paper.
In
addition
the
self-interaction
for
a
static
point
charge
is
calculated
in
a
series
expansion
in
a
BTZ
black
hole
and
also
in
an
wormhole
constructed
connecting
two
identical
BTZ
geometries.
The
electrostatic
self-force
is
evaluated
numerically
and
compared
in
both
cases.
The
differences
between
the
self
force
in
both
cases
is
a
theoretical
experiment
for
distinguishing
both
geometries,
which
otherwise
are
locally
indistinguishable.
