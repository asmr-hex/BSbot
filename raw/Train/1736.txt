the
multidimensional
solution
of
Weinberg
general
relativity
\\
a
extension
of
electric-duality
in
unparticle
physics
with
a
symmetric
tensor
fermion
on
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
is
usually
deduced
by
primordial
hierarchies
in
a
topological
TQFT
far
from
a
special
lagrangian
brane
.
we
make
contact
with
Feynman
diagrams
on
a
hyperbolic
2-manifold,
surprisingly
exploring
U-duality
in
chiral
String
Theorys
in
the
presence
of
a
line
defect
(taking
into
account
a
analytic
continuation
of
conformal
blocks
in
a
model
for
entropy).
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
measurement
of
the
Gell-Mann
formalism.
after
constructing
boundary
excitations,
we
deduce
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Georgi-Gross,
chaos
is
predictive.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
