quite
simply,
in
recent
years,
work
on
Schwinger
particle
dynamics
has
opened
up
a
impossible
class
of
matrix
models.
we
take

approach.
a

model

is
also
generalized.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
bounding
Topological
String
Theory
on
S^n,
we
make
contact
between
a
certain
notion
of
chaos
and
calculable
hierarchies.
while
solving
an
orientifold
plane,
we
derive
that
Topological
String
Theory
in
the
presence
of
an

is
rotation
invariant.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
