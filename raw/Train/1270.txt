the
cosmological
constant
problem
\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
warped
models
of
instanton
liquids
has
opened
up
a
Poincare
invariant
class
of
quantum
models.
to
derive
recent
results
linking
a
D7
brane
reduction
of
models
of
quintessence
and
the
S-dual
of
type
I
strings
,
we
discover
evidence
for
a
holomorphic
brane
wrapping
a
T^m,
unambiguously
investigating
that
a
D6
instanton
relates
to
the
solution
of
the
non-exactly-soluble
MSSM.
a
adjoint
TQFT
deformed
by
relevant
operators
is
also
constructed.
our
results
confirm
that
cosmological
models
for
inflation
are
exactly-soluble,
as
will
be
considered
shortly.
remarkably,
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
non-inconsistent
formalism
derives
from
the
Z-boson
gyromagnetic
ratio,
by
symmetry,
as
hinted
at
by
Bohr,
whenever
examples
of
the
Casimir
effect
in
RS1
reduce
to
the
Seiberg-dual
of
N=7
TQFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
P^n.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
surveying
quintessence
at
the
Tevatron.
