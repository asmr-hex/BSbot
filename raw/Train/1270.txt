Correlation
functions
for
Galilean
conformal
invariant
field
theory
\\
In
this
paper
we
consider
non-relativistic-conformal
group,
then
we
calculate
two
point
function
for
the
fields
that
are
Galilean
conformal-invariant,
then
we
show
that
the
correlation
function
for
Galilean
conformal-invariant
fields
in
$d=2$
are
different
from
$d\neq2$.
Our
result
in
$d\neq2$
is
different
with
previous
results
in
\cite{3}.
