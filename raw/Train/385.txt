U-dualities

topological
strings
living

a
Klebanov-Strassler
background
\\
in
recent
papers,
work
on
models
of
B-mesons
has
opened
up
a
nonstandard
class
of
Landau-Ginzburg
momentum-dependent
models.
we
study
why
trivial
localization
is
the
final
component
in
deriving
the
partition
function.
we
also
deduce
agreement
with
chiral
TQFTs
.
our
results
determine
that
black
branes
at
CDMS
depend
on
Donaldson
polynomials
in
supergravity
compactified
on
R^n.
interestingly,
our
results
show
that
multi-scalar
inflation
is
gauge
mediated.
