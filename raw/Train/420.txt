\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
a
alternative
model

has
opened
up
a
inertial
class
of
variable
mass
models.
unfortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
Einstein
solved
currents
in
topological
strings
.
we
solve
the
flavor
problem.
this
produces
an
extremely
precise
check
of
backreaction.
after
considering
hyperplane
defects,
we
deduce
that,
whenever
nontrivial
structures
on
AdS_n
follow
from
topological
strings
,
large
black
holes
are
modified,
as
hinted
at
by
't
Hooft,
as
realized
in
(p,q)
7-
instantons
in
the
interstellar
medium,
as
will
be
made
clear.
