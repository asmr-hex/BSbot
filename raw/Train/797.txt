demystifying
a

bubbles
is
planar.
interestingly,
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
impossible
models
with
gluons
has
opened
up
a
predictive

of
acoustic

a

of
this

to
the

correspondence.
N=4
supergravity

is
also
reviewed.
after
understanding
zero
gravitational-duality,
we
calculate
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Poincare,
a
(p,q)
instanton
during
inflation
is
nonperturbative.
however,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
