Ab
Initio
Estimates
of
the
Size
of
the
Observable
Universe
\\
When
one
combines
multiverse
predictions
by
Bousso,
Hall,
and
Nomura
for
the
observed
age
and
size
of
the
universe
in
terms
of
the
proton
and
electron
charge
and
masses
with
anthropic
predictions
of
Carter,
Carr,
and
Rees
for
these
masses
in
terms
of
the
charge,
one
gets
that
the
age
of
the
universe
should
be
roughly
the
inverse
64th
power,
and
the
cosmological
constant
should
be
around
the
128th
power,
of
the
proton
charge.
Combining
these
with
a
further
renormalization
group
argument
gives
a
single
approximate
equation
for
the
proton
charge,
with
no
continuous
adjustable
or
observed
parameters,
and
with
a
solution
that
is
within
8%
of
the
observed
value.
Using
this
solution
gives
large
logarithms
for
the
age
and
size
of
the
universe
and
for
the
cosmological
constant
that
agree
with
the
observed
values
within
17%.
