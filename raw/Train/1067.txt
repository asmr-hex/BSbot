Inflation,
quintessence,
and
the
origin
of
mass
\\
In
a
unified
picture
both
inflation
and
present
dynamical
dark
energy
arise
from
the
same
scalar
field.
The
history
of
the
Universe
describes
a
crossover
from
a
scale
invariant
"past
fixed
point"
where
all
particles
are
massless,
to
a
"future
fixed
point"
where
spontaneous
breaking
of
the
exact
scale
symmetry
generates
the
particle
masses.
The
cosmological
solution
can
be
extrapolated
to
the
infinite
past
in
physical
time
-
the
universe
has
no
beginning.
This
is
seen
most
easily
in
a
frame
where
particle
masses
and
the
Planck
mass
are
field-dependent
and
increase
with
time.
In
this
"freeze
frame"
the
Universe
shrinks
and
heats
up
during
radiation
and
matter
domination.
In
the
equivalent,
but
singular
Einstein
frame
cosmic
history
finds
the
familiar
big
bang
description.
The
first
stage
of
the
crossover
ends
inflation.
For
the
primordial
fluctuations
we
find
a
spectral
index
$n\lesssim
0.967$
and
a
tensor
amplitude
$r\gtrsim
0.13$,
with
typical
values
close
to
the
bounds.
The
crossover
is
completed
by
a
second
stage
where
a
standard-model-singlet
sector
makes
the
transition
to
the
future
fixed
point.
The
resulting
increase
of
neutrino
masses
stops
a
cosmological
scaling
solution,
relating
the
present
dark
energy
density
to
the
present
neutrino
mass.
A
simple
model
with
no
more
free
parameters
than
$\Lambda$CDM
is
compatible
with
all
present
observational
tests.
