Black
brane
solutions
governed
by
fluxbrane
polynomials
\\
A
family
of
composite
black
brane
solutions
in
the
model
with
scalar
fields
and
fields
of
forms
is
presented.
The
metric
of
any
solution
is
defined
on
a
manifold
which
contains
a
product
of
several
Ricci-flat
"internal"
spaces.
The
solutions
are
governed
by
moduli
functions
H_s
(s
=
1,
...,
m)
obeying
non-linear
differential
equations
with
certain
boundary
conditions
imposed.
These
master
equations
are
equivalent
to
Toda-like
equations
and
depend
upon
the
non-degenerate
(m
x
m)
matrix
A.
It
was
conjectured
earlier
that
the
functions
H_s
should
be
polynomials
if
A
is
a
Cartan
matrix
for
some
semisimple
finite-dimensional
Lie
algebra
(of
rank
m).
It
is
shown
that
the
solutions
to
master
equations
may
be
found
by
using
so-called
fluxbrane
polynomials
which
can
be
calculated
(in
principle)
for
any
semisimple
finite-dimensional
Lie
algebra.
Examples
of
dilatonic
charged
black
hole
(0-brane)
solutions
related
to
Lie
algebras
A_1,
A_2,
C_2
and
G_2
are
considered.
