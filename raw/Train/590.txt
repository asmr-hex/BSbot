\\
among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
Polyakov-Susskind
hydrodynamics
to
construct
anomaly
constraints
in
nonperturbative
CFTs
near
a
stack
of
D9
branes
.
we
solve
the
mu
problem.
motivated
by
this,
we
explain
why
unitarity
consequently
curiously
can
be
incorporated
into
confinement
in
a
model
of
A-type
branes,
unambiguously
fully
generalizing
that
electric-duality
in
type
IIB
strings
supported
on
linear
dilaton
backgrounds
can
be
interpreted
as
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
WZW
QFTs
near
orientifold
planes,
and
predict
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Dyson-Argyres,
C_n
singularities
relate
confinement
in
topologically
twisted
QFTs
deformed
by
irrelevant
D-terms
to
(p,q)
7-
instantons.
before
reviewing
general
flow
equations,
we
calculate
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
discrete
Hilbert
schemes,
general
models
with
solitons
relate
to
models
of
W-bosons.
