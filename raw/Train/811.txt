Topological
charge
membranes
and
Goldstone
boson
propagation
in
QCD
\\
Both
theoretical
arguments
and
Monte
Carlo
observations
indicate
that
the
topological
structure
of
the
QCD
vacuum
consists
of
a
laminated
array
of
extended,
coherent
codimension-one
membranes
of
alternating
sign.
Large-$N_c$
arguments,
supported
by
gauge/string
holography,
indicate
that
these
membranes
are
domain
walls
which
separate
discrete
"flux
vacua"
with
values
of
the
topological
$\theta$
parameter
which
differ
by
$\pm
2\pi$.
This
exposes
a
close
analogy
with
2D
U(1)
gauge
theory,
where
$\theta$
can
be
interpreted
as
electric
polarization,
and
the
domain
walls
are
pointlike
charged
particles.
In
4D
QCD,
the
$\theta$
parameter
represents
background
Ramond-Ramond
flux,
which
can
be
interpreted
as
a
polarization
of
the
charged
membranes
in
the
vacuum.
In
this
framework,
the
chiral
condensate
is
formed
from
the
quark
surface
modes
on
the
membranes.
Massless
Goldstone
boson
propagation
takes
place
due
to
a
coordination
between
bulk
oscillations
of
the
polarization
field
$\theta$
and
the
surface
currents
represented
by
the
Chern-Simons
3-form
on
the
brane
surface.
This
coordination
is
enforced
by
overall
gauge
invariance
which
imposes
an
anomaly
inflow
constraint
between
bulk
and
surface
currents.
