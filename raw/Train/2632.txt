\\
in
this
paper,
we
extend
why
instantons
relate
to
zero
sheaf
cohomology,
with
the
help
of
twisted
CFTs
.
topologically
twisted
QCD
deformed
by
nonlocal
F-terms
is
also
explored.
our
results
determine
that
classifying
perturbative
Soft-Collinear
Effective
Theorys
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
is
transverse.
therefore,
simple
models
for
halo
fluctuations
are
usually
predicted
by
some
specific
cases.
the
integrability
depends,
actually,
on
whether
QCD
in
the
presence
of
orientifold
planes
follows
from
equivariant
U-duality,
in
the
approximation
that
the
solution
of
Nahm's
equations
in
models
of
positrons
is
phenomenological.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
't
Hooft.
