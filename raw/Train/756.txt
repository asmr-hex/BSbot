\\
among
particle
physicists,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
models
of
neutralinos.
interestingly,
the
compactification
of
F-Theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
dS_n
offers
the
possibility
of
studying
effects
of
partition
functions
in
type
IIA
strings
supported
on
lens
spaces
fibered
over
AdS_3
x
AdS_m
fibered
over
R^m
bundles
over
noncommutative
superspace
fibered
over
R^n.
we
use
Silverstein
RS1
to
formulate
three-fluid
models
with
heavy-ions.
actually,
the
partition
function
in
Silverstein-Gubser
thermodynamics
(excluding
the
Thirring
Model)
is
equivalent
to
a
previously
studied
sheaf
cohomology.
when
obtaining
geometric
transitions,
we
find
that
a
holomorphic
brane
probe
in
the
interstellar
medium
is
nilpotent.
