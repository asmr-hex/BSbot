In-medium
effects
in
the
holographic
quark-gluon
plasma
\\
In
this
dissertation
we
use
the
D3/D7
model
in
gauge/gravity
duality
to
investigate
the
effects
of
finite
temperature
and
particle
density
on
matter
in
strongly
coupled
super-Yang-Mills
gauge
theories,
which
we
interpret
as
models
for
the
quark-gluon
plasma
(QGP).
