On
a
Gopakumar-Vafa
form
of
partition
function
of
Chern-Simons
theory
on
classical
and
exceptional
lines
\\
We
show
that
partition
function
of
Chern-Simons
theory
on
three-sphere
with
classical
and
exceptional
groups
(actually
on
the
whole
corresponding
lines
in
Vogel's
plane)
can
be
represented
as
ratio
of
respectively
triple
and
double
sine
functions
(last
function
is
essentially
a
modular
quantum
dilogarithm).
The
product
representation
of
sine
functions
gives
Gopakumar-Vafa
structure
form
of
partition
function,
which
in
turn
gives
a
corresponding
integer
invariants
of
manifold
after
geometrical
transition.
In
this
way
we
suggest
to
extend
gauge/string
duality
to
exceptional
groups,
although
one
still
have
to
resolve
few
problems.
In
both
classical
and
exceptional
cases
an
additional
terms,
non-perturbative
w.r.t.
the
string
coupling
constant,
appear.
The
full
universal
partition
function
of
Chern-Simons
theory
on
three-sphere
is
shown
to
be
the
ratio
of
quadruple
sine
functions.
We
also
briefly
discuss
the
matrix
model
for
exceptional
line.
