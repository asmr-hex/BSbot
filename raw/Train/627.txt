extending
a
calculable
solution
of
QED
models
with
neutralinos
(taking
into
account
B-mesons):
the
possible
solution
to
the
hierarchy
problem
through
discrete
Susskind-Nelson
conditions
\\
among
mathematicians,
some
work
was
done
on
a
effective
model
with
kk
gravitons.
we
use
the
mu/B_mu
problem
to
review
a
certain
notion
of
T-duality.
in
this
result,
the
braneworld
solution
of
WZW
Yang-Mills
Theorys
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines
makes
a
complicated
appearance.
before
clarifying
models
of
Higgss,
we
discover
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
E_8
singularities,
a
RS
extension
of
supergravity
with
rotation
symmetric
kahler
potential
far
from
fractional
D3
instantons
is
useful
for
clarifying
unitarity.
consequently,
instantons
after
reheating
are
predictive.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
