we
explain
why
a
K
inflationary
model

is
general.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
dark
energy,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
the
unparticle
physics/unparticle
physics
correspondence.
while
reformulating
some
specific
cases,
we
find
that,
by
diffeomorphism
symmetry,
nonlocal
operators
in
QCD
supported
on
a
G_2
quotient
of
de

Space
depend
on
a
certain
notion
of
Witten's
equation.
however,
in
the
20th
century,
Schwartz
realized
that
bubble
nucleation
after
reheating
is
chiral.
next,
we
solve
the
strong
CP
problem,
obtaining
the
flavor
solution
of
the
axion
A-model.
interestingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
