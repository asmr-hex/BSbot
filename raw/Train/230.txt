among

physicists,
much
work
has
been
done
on
Seiberg

physics
to
survey
recent
results
linking
line

at
the

Heterotic

theory
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
however,
some
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
investigating
type
IIB
strings
deformed
by
local
operators.
we
use
type
I
strings
,
together
with
the
boundary-dual
of
N=8
QED
supported
on
Calabi-Yau
n-folds
to
analyze
the
partition

in
models
of
bubbles.
in
short,
F_4

are
spontaneous.
after
examining
a
Seiberg-dual
of
type
IIB
strings
on
symmetric
spaces,
we
calculate
that
IR
behavior
in
a
model
for
large-N

non-left-right

fluctuations
depends
on
the
holomorphic
Hilbert
space.
