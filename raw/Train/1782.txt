Inflation
with
negative
potentials
and
the
signature
reversal
symmetry
\\
We
discuss
recent
papers
by
Hartle,
Hawking
and
Hertog,
which
proposed
that
quantum
cosmology
could
predict
an
inflating
universe
in
models
with
negative
scalar
potentials.
Here
we
show
that
this
is
a
result
of
an
underlying
symmetry
which
is
manifest
in
both
classical
and
quantum
theory.
Moreover,
we
show
that
inflating
solutions
in
such
models
generally
develop
tachyonic
and
ghost
instabilities
and
are
therefore
unphysical
in
realistic
theories.
