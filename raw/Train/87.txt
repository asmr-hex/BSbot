A
landscape
of
non-supersymmetric
AdS
vacua
on
coset
manifolds
\\
We
construct
new
families
of
non-supersymmetric
sourceless
type
IIA
AdS4
vacua
on
those
coset
manifolds
that
also
admit
supersymmetric
solutions.
We
investigate
the
spectrum
of
left-invariant
modes
and
find
that
most,
but
not
all,
of
the
vacua
are
stable
under
these
fluctuations.
Generically,
there
are
also
no
massless
moduli.
