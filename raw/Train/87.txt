Rotating
Black
Branes
in
the
presence
of
nonlinear
electromagnetic
field
\\
In
this
paper,
we
consider
a
class
of
gravity
whose
action
represents
itself
as
a
sum
of
the
usual
Einstein-Hilbert
action
with
cosmological
constant
and
an
$U(1)$
gauge
field
for
which
the
action
is
given
by
a
power
of
the
Maxwell
invariant.
We
present
a
class
of
the
rotating
black
branes
with
Ricci
flat
horizon
and
show
that
the
presented
solutions
may
be
interpreted
as
black
brane
solutions
with
two
event
horizons,
extreme
black
hole
and
naked
singularity
provided
the
parameters
of
the
solutions
are
chosen
suitably.
We
investigate
the
properties
of
the
solutions
and
find
that
for
the
special
values
of
the
nonlinear
parameter,
the
solutions
are
not
asymptotically
anti-deSitter.
At
last,
we
obtain
the
conserved
quantities
of
the
rotating
black
branes
and
find
that
the
nonlinear
source
effects
on
the
electric
field,
the
behavior
of
spacetime,
type
of
singularity
and
other
quantities.
