Path
integral
action
of
a
particle
in
the
non
commutative
plane
\\
Non
commutative
quantum
mechanics
can
be
viewed
as
a
quantum
system
represented
in
the
space
of
Hilbert-Schmidt
operators
acting
on
non
commutative
configuration
space.
Taking
this
as
departure
point,
we
formulate
a
coherent
state
approach
to
the
path
integral
representation
of
the
transition
amplitude.
