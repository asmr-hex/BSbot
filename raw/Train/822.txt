of

a
deeper
understanding
of
the
physics
associated
with
cosmological
and
null
singularities.
In
this
paper,
we
report
both
brane
solutions
and
their
bound
states
in
light-cone
time
dependent
pp
wave-like
backgrounds.
We
show
that
the
backgrounds
our
solutions
live
in
are
all
cosmologically
singular
(lightlike)
at
the
classical
level.
A

analysis
of
the
backgrounds
reveals
that
they
retain
1/8
of
the
full
type
IIB
supersymmetry.
