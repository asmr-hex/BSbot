Two
Dimensional
Horava-Lifshitz
Black
Hole
Solutions
\\
In
this
paper
we
address
the
issue
of
black
hole
solutions
in
(1+1)-dimensional
non-projectable
Horava-Lifshitz
gravity.
We
consider
several
models
by
considering
different
potentials
in
the
scalar
matter
sector.
We
also
consider
the
gravitational
collapse
of
a
distribution
of
pressureless
dust
filling
a
region
in
one-dimensional
space.
The
time
of
the
collapse
can
be
faster
or
slower
depending
on
the
parameter
$\lambda$
of
the
theory.
