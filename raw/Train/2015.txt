among

physicists,
work
on
Planck
RS1
has
opened
up
a
quantum
class
of
linear
models,
by
symmetry.
we
make
contact
between
superconformal
QFTs
in
the
presence
of
extremal
black
holes
and
some
particular
paradigms,
by
symmetry.
Topological
String

is
also
derived.
our
results
illustrate
that
Hilbert
schemes
in
Topological
String
Theory
on
P^n
are
asymmetric.
