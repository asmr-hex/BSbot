Vortices
and
supercurrent
in
AdS
Born-Infeld
gravity
\\
In
this
paper,
based
on
the
fundamental
principles
of
AdS/CFT
duality
and
considering
the
\textit{probe}
limit,
we
study
the
effect
of
Born
Infeld
(BI)
coupling
both
on
the
vortex
lattice
structure
as
well
as
on
the
expression
for
the
supercurrent
in
holographic
type
II
superconductors
whose
dual
description
consists
of
an
abelian
Higgs
model
coupled
to
gravity
in
a
four
dimensional
$
AdS_4
$
space
time.
It
is
observed
that
at
low
temperatures
the
\textit{global}
$
U(1)
$
current
thus
computed
for
the
boundary
theory
receives
a
highly
nontrivial
contribution
appearing
at
the
leading
order
in
the
BI
coupling
($
b
$).
In
the
light
of
\textit{long
wave
length
approximation},
we
note
that
the
so
called
\textit{non
local}
version
of
the
supercurrent
boils
down
to
a
\textit{local}
form
along
with
some
finite
low
temperature
correction
to
the
usual
Ginzburg
Landau
version
of
the
supercurrent
in
type
II
superconductors.
Finally,
we
also
compute
the
free
energy
corresponding
to
the
triangular
lattice
configuration.
It
is
observed
that
the
free
energy
exhibits
similar
low
temperature
effects
at
the
leading
order
in
the
BI
coupling
($
b
$).
