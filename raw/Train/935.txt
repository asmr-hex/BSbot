Some
remarks
on
D-branes
and
defects
in
Liouville
and
Toda
field
theories
\\
In
this
paper
we
analyze
the
Cardy-Lewellen
equation
in
general
diagonal
model.
We
show
that
in
these
models
it
takes
simple
form
due
to
some
general
properties
of
conformal
field
theories,
like
pentagon
equations
and
OPE
associativity.
This
implies,
that
the
Cardy-Lewellen
equation
has
simple
form
also
in
non-rational
diagonal
models.
We
specialize
our
finding
to
the
Liouville
and
Toda
field
theories.
In
particular
we
prove,
that
conjectured
recently
defects
in
Toda
field
theory
indeed
satisfy
the
cluster
equation.
We
also
derive
the
Cardy-Lewellen
equation
in
all
$sl(n)$
Toda
field
theories
and
prove
that
the
forms
of
boundary
states
found
recently
in
$sl(3)$
Toda
field
theory
hold
in
all
$sl(n)$
theories
as
well.
