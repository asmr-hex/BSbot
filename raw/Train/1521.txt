The
Casimir
effect
in
light-front
quantization
\\
We
show
that
the
standard
result
for
the
Casimir
force
between
conducting
plates
at
rest
in
an
inertial
frame
can
be
computed
in
light-front
quantization.
This
is
not
the
same
as
light-front
analyses
where
the
plates
are
at
"rest"
in
an
infinite
momentum
frame.
In
that
case,
Lenz
and
Steinbacher
have
shown
that
the
result
does
not
agree
with
the
standard
result
for
plates
at
rest.
The
two
important
ingredients
in
the
present
analysis
are
a
careful
treatment
of
the
boundary
conditions,
inspired
by
the
work
of
Almeida
et
al.
on
oblique
light-front
coordinates,
and
computation
of
the
ordinary
energy
density,
rather
than
the
light-front
energy
density.
