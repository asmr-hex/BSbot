in
recent
papers,
little
work
was
done
bounding
type
IIA

in
a
way
that
produces
partition
functions.
actually,
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching
is
usually
derived
through
"breaking
of
Poincare
symmetry".
we
illustrate
a
critical
correspondence
between
general
conformal
blocks
and
examples
of
partition
functions
in
models
of
dark
matter.
the

of
this
article
refers
to

our
results
establish
that
Feynman
diagrams
in
String
theories
in
the
presence
of
B-type
branes
wrapping
a
AdS_9
can
be
interpreted
as
A-type
instantons.
surprisingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
