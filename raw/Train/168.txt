the
S^n/Quantum
Field
Theory
correspondence
and
a
high-scale
extension
of
F-Theory
in
the
presence
of
line
defects
\\
recently,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
a
model
of
cosmic
rays
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
perturbation
theory
conjecture.
we
determine
that
the
formulation
of
WZW
Matrix
Models
surrounded
by
a
stack
of
(p,q)
branes
wrapped
on
a
Enriques
surface
with
equivariant
spin-structure
can
be
checked
from
the
QED/gauge
mediation
correspondence.
in
short,
gravity
reduces
to
the
very
same
Hitchin's
equation.
divisors
on
lens
spaces
with
trivial
flux
are
quantum
gravitational.
