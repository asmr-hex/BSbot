compute
the
leading
correction
to
the
structure
constant
for
the
three-point
function
of
two
length-two
and
one
length-four
chiral
primary
operators
in
planar
ABJ(M)
theory
at
weak
't

coupling.
The
computation
is
reduced
to
four-loop
propagator
type
Feynman
integrals
via
a
manifestly
finite
integration
over
the
position
of
the
length-four
operator.
