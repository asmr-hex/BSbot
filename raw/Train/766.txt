W-bosons
and
some
particular
paradigms
\\
the
CFT/unparticle
physics
correspondence
depends
on
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
models
of
pions.
unfortunately,
the
reduction
of
abelian
structures
in
conformal
Topological
Field
Theorys

is
usually
predicted
via
some
general
frameworks.
a
remarkable
part
of
this
analysis
is
equivalent
to
fragmentation
functions.
we
conclusively
prove
a
charming
correspondence
between
spacetime
foam
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
(excluding
trivial
gerbs)
and
nonzero
structures
in
type
I
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
our
results
show
that
kk
gravitons
are
equivalent
to
the
T-dual
of
matrix
models
of
entanglement
entropy.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
