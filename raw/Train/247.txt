Holographic
superconductors
in
a
model
of
non-relativistic
gravity
\\
We
have
studied
holographic
superconductors
with
spherical
symmetry
in
the
Ho$\check{\textbf{r}}$ava-Lifshitz
gravity
by
using
a
semi
analytical
method,
and
also
we
have
calculated
the
critical
temperature
and
shown
when
the
condensation
will
appear
in
a
similar
pattern
as
in
the
Einstein-Gauss-
Bonnet
gravity.
We
have
computed
the
dependency
of
the
conductivity
as
a
function
of
frequency
in
this
new
non-relativistic
model
of
quantum
gravity.
