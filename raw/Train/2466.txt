Higher
Spins
and
Open
Strings:
Quartic
Interactions
\\
We
analyze
quartic
gauge-invariant
interactions
of
massless
higher
spin
fields
by
using
vertex
operators
constructed
in
our
previous
works
and
computing
their
four-point
amplitudes
in
superstring
theory.
The
kinematic
part
of
the
quartic
interactions
of
the
higher
spins
is
determined
by
the
matter
structure
of
their
vertex
operators;the
non-locality
of
the
interactions
is
the
consequence
of
specific
ghost
structure
of
these
operators.
We
compute
explicitly
the
four-point
amplitude
describing
the
complete
gauge-invariant
$1-1-3-3$
quartic
interaction
(two
massless
spin
3
particles
interacting
with
two
photons)
and
comment
on
more
general
$1-1-s-s$
cases,
particularly
pointing
out
the
structure
of
$1-1-5-5$
coupling.
