Inflation
in
the
Generalized
Inverse
Power
Law
Scenario
\\
We
propose
a
single
field
inflationary
model
by
generalizing
the
inverse
power
law
potential
from
the
intermediate
model.
We
study
the
implication
of
our
model
on
the
primordial
anisotropy
of
cosmological
microwave
background
radiation.
Specifically,
we
apply
the
slow-roll
approximation
to
calculate
the
scalar
spectral
tilt
$n_s$
and
the
tensor-to-scalar
ratio
$r$.
The
results
are
compared
with
the
recent
data
measured
by
the
Planck
satellite.
We
found
that
by
choosing
proper
values
for
the
parameters,
our
model
can
well
describe
the
Planck
data.
