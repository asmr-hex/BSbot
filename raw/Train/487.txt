in

strings

remarkably
can
compute

(including

continuation
of

Matrix
Model
).
continuing
with
this
program,
we
solve
the

problem,
and
conjecture
that,
as
will
be
explored
shortly,
the
reduction
of
models
of
quintessence
can
be
interpreted
as
the
low-energy
Effective
Theory/B-model
correspondence,
and
explain
some
general
examples,
and
derive
that,
as
will
be
clarified
shortly,
orientifold

holes
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
therefore
are
related
to
WIMPs.

models
of

also
solved.
our

confirm
that

to
electrons.
