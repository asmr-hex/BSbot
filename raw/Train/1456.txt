Higher
spin
fields
with
reversed
spin-statistics
relation
\\
A
construction
of
massive
free
fields
with
arbitrary
spin
and
reversed
spin-statistics
relation
is
presented.
In
the
construction
of
these
fields
normal
(physical)
fields
with
the
same
spin
are
taken
as
starting
point,
thus
a
correspondence
between
fields
obeying
normal
and
reversed
spin-statistics
relation
is
established.
In
particular,
the
polarization
states,
(anti)commutators,
Feynman
propagators
and
Green
functions
of
the
fields
with
reversed
spin-statistics
relation
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
those
of
the
normal
fields
to
which
they
correspond.
The
cases
of
the
scalar
and
Dirac
fields
are
discussed
in
additional
detail.
