Nernst
branes
in
gauged
supergravity
\\
We
study
static
black
brane
solutions
in
the
context
of
N
=
2
U(1)
gauged
supergravity
in
four
dimensions.
Using
the
formalism
of
first-order
flow
equations,
we
construct
novel
extremal
black
brane
solutions
including
examples
of
Nernst
branes,
i.e.
extremal
black
brane
solutions
with
vanishing
entropy
density.
We
also
discuss
a
class
of
non-extremal
generalizations
which
is
captured
by
the
first-order
formalism.
