Effective
Field
Theories
for
Local
Models
in
F-Theory
and
M-Theory
\\
Requiring
a
strictly
local
origin
of
visible
sector
phenomenology
is
perhaps
the
strongest,
most
falsifiable
condition
that
one
can
impose
on
string
theory
at
the
high
scale:
it
at
once
excludes
a
vast
majority
of
the
string
landscape,
and
yet
leads
naturally
to
constructions
that
can
be
surprisingly
realistic
(and
familiar).
Yet
only
for
local
models
can
gravity
be
made
parametrically
weak
while
keeping
the
strength
of
gauge-
and
Yukawa-couplings
fixed--a
limit
which
is
well-motivated
by
low-energy
experiments.
Conveniently,
the
entire
class
of
high-scale
effective
field
theories
that
can
arise
from
such
local
models
in
F-theory
and
M-theory
can
be
classified
according
to
simple,
purely
group-theoretic
rules.
In
this
note,
we
describe
these
rules
from
the
viewpoint
of
an
effective
field
theorist
with
little
interest
in
the
underlying
geometry
or
high-scale
physics,
and
we
discuss
the
general
predictions
these
models
have
for
low-energy
phenomenology.
