Holographic
backgrounds
from
D-brane
probes
\\
This
thesis
focuses
on
the
derivation
of
holographic
backgrounds
from
the
field
theory
side,
without
using
any
supergravity
equations
of
motion.
Instead,
we
rely
on
the
addition
of
probe
D-branes
to
the
stack
of
D-branes
generating
the
background.
From
the
field
theory
description
of
the
probe
branes,
one
can
compute
an
effective
action
for
the
probes
(in
a
suitable
low-energy/near-horizon
limit)
by
integrating
out
the
background
branes.
Comparing
this
action
with
the
generic
probe
D-brane
action
then
allows
to
determine
the
holographic
background
dual
to
the
considered
field
theory
vacuum.
