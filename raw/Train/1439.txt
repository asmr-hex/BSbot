Relaxation
time
of
non-conformal
plasma
\\
We
study
effective
relaxation
time
of
viscous
hydrodynamics
of
strongly
coupled
non-conformal
gauge
theory
plasma
using
gauge
theory/string
theory
correspondence.
We
compute
leading
corrections
to
the
conformal
plasma
relaxation
time
from
the
relevant
deformations
due
to
dim-2
and
dim-3
operators.
We
discuss
in
details
the
relaxation
time
tau_eff
of
N=2^*
plasma.
For
a
certain
choice
of
masses
this
theory
undergoes
a
phase
transition
with
divergent
specific
heat
c_V
~
|1-T_c/T|^(-1/2).
Although
the
bulk
viscosity
remains
finite
all
the
way
to
the
critical
temperature,
we
find
that
tau_eff
diverges
near
the
critical
point
as
tau_eff
~
|1-T_c/T|^(-1/2).
