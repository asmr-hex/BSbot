the

gives
rise
to
a
sophisticated
framework
for
reviewing
entropy
after
reheating,
in
the

that
some
specific
computations
depend
on
a

in
the
high-scale
Politzer
Model.
we
present
a

consequently,
the

correspondence
relates
to
anomaly
matching.
after

Model,
we
calculate
that

inflationary.
our

are

Beckenstein.
