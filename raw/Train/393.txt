Scattering
vector
mesons
in
D4/D8
model
\\
We
review
in
this
proceedings
some
recent
results
for
vector
meson
form
factors
obtained
using
the
holographic
D4-D8
brane
model.
The
D4-D8
brane
model,
proposed
by
Sakai
and
Sugimoto,
is
a
holographic
dual
of
a
semi-realistic
strongly
coupled
large
N_c
QCD
since
it
breaks
supersymmetry
and
incorporates
chiral
symmetry
breaking.
We
analyze
the
vector
meson
wave
functions
and
Regge
trajectories
as
well.
