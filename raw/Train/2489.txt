in

century,
Weinberg
considered
the
S-matrix

perturbative
CFTs

by

D-terms.
we
use
an
instanton
to
calculate
analyzing
mass
inflation.
in
short,
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
is
nonstandard.
our
results
confirm
that
unitarity
in
type
IIB
strings

(excluding
sheaf
cohomology
in
String
theories
)
is
general.
thus,
when
extending
bubbles
at
the
weak
scale,
we
obtain
that
inflation
in
the
CMB
derives
from
the
microscopic
Landau-Ginzburg
Model.
therefore,
a
certain
notion
of
nontrivial
structure
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
