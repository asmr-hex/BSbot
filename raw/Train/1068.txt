On
finite
interquark
potential
in
$D=3$
driven
by
a
minimal
length
\\
We
address
the
effect
of
a
quantum
gravity
induced
minimal
length
on
a
physical
observable
for
three-
dimensional
Yang-Mills.
Our
calculation
is
done
within
stationary
perturbation
theory.
Interestingly
enough,
we
find
an
ultraviolet
finite
interaction
energy,
which
contains
a
regularized
logarithmic
function
and
a
linear
confining
potential.
This
result
highlights
the
role
played
by
the
new
quantum
of
length
in
our
discussion.
