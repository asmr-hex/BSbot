regularization

We
analyze
the
consistency
of
the
recently
proposed
regularization
of
an
identity
based
solution
in
open
bosonic
string
field
theory.
We
show
that
the
equation
of
motion
is
satisfied
when
it
is
contracted
with
the
regularized
solution
itself.
Additionally,
we
propose
a
similar
regularization
of
an
identity
based
solution
in
the
modified
cubic
superstring
field
theory.
