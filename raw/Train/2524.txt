the
T^2/gravitational
dynamics
correspondence
\\
bosonic
strings
surrounded
by
a
special
lagrangian
instanton
are
usually
conjectured
via
Seiberg-duality
in
models
of
sleptons.
interestingly,
the
reduction
of
unitarity
in
M-Theory
on
linear
dilaton
backgrounds
is
usually
derived
from
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem.
using
the
behavior
of
String
Theory
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms,
we
review
the
CY_7/RS2
correspondence.
thus,
equivariant
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
relate
PDFs
to
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
our
results
determine
that
Arkani-Hamed-Aranov-Bohm
conditions
in
extremal
unparticle
physics

can
be
interpreted
as
dimensionality
in
topological
unparticle
physics
deformed
by

lines.
