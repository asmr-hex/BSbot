Covariant
constraints
for
generic
massive
gravity
and
analysis
of
its
characteristics
\\
We
perform
a
covariant
constraint
analysis
of
massive
gravity
valid
for
its
entire
parameter
space,
demonstrating
that
the
model
generically
propagates
five
degrees
of
freedom;
this
is
also
verified
by
a
new
and
streamlined
Hamiltonian
description.
The
constraint's
covariant
expression
permits
computation
of
the
model's
caustics.
Although
new
features
such
as
the
dynamical
Riemann
tensor
appear
in
the
characteristic
matrix,
the
model
still
exhibits
the
pathologies
uncovered
in
earlier
work:
superluminality
and
likely
acausalities.
