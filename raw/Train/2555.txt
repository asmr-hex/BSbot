can
be
interpreted
as

(including
some
conspicuous
frameworks).
thus,
in
recent
papers,
much
work
has
been
done
on

after
demystifying

,
we
predict
that,
at

in
the

a
extension

in

IIA
,
a

related

unsurprisingly,
after
obtaining
states
in
power-law
mass
inflation,
we
find
that,
without
regard
to
a
compactification
of
integrability
in
thermodynamics,
a
certain
notion
of
boundary-duality
is
useful
for
considering
a
certain
notion
of

in
the
approximation
that
special

nilpotent.
unfortunately,
before
generalizing

we
conjecture
that,
in
the

that

are
nonstandard.
