Covariant
gravity
with
Lagrange
multiplier
constraint
\\
We
review
on
the
models
of
gravity
with
a
constraint
by
the
Lagrange
multiplier
field.
The
constraint
breaks
general
covariance
or
Lorentz
symmetry
in
the
ultraviolet
region.
We
report
on
the
$F(R)$
gravity
model
with
the
constraint
and
the
proposal
of
the
covariant
(power-counting)
renormalized
gravity
model
by
using
the
constraint
and
scalar
projectors.
We
will
show
that
the
model
admits
flat
space
solution,
its
gauge-fixing
formulation
is
fully
developed,
and
the
only
propagating
mode
is
(higher
derivative)
graviton,
while
scalar
and
vector
modes
do
not
propagate.
The
preliminary
study
of
FRW
cosmology
indicates
to
the
possibility
of
inflationary
universe
solution
is
also
given.
