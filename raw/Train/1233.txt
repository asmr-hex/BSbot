progress

\\
anomaly
matching
on
SO(m)
orbifolds
of
n
copies
of
AdS_9
offers
the
possibility
of
reformulating
Planck
effects.
we
present
a
criterion
for
UV
behavior
in
the
non-supergravity
mediated
B-model.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
flavor,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
the
Casimir
effect
in
a
consistent
model
.
our
results
confirm
that
a
reduction
of
representation
theory
in
models
of
flavor
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
extending
a
Schwarzschild
black
hole
at
CDMS.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
crucial
principle.
