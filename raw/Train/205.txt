Mirror
Symmetry
for
a
large
class
of
three
dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=4$
supersymmetric
gauge
theories
has
a
natural
explanation
in
terms
of
M-theory
compactified
on
a
product
of
$\text{ALE}$
spaces.
A
pair
of
such
mirror
duals
can
be
described
as
two
different
deformations
of
the
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
background
$\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^{2,1}
\times
\text{ALE}_{1}
\times
\text{ALE}_{2}$,
to
which
they
flow
in
the
deep
IR.
Using
the
$A-D-E$
classification
of
$\text{ALE}$
spaces,
we
present
a
neat
way
to
catalogue
dual
quiver
gauge
theories
that
arise
in
this
fashion.
In
addition
to
the
well-known
examples
studied
in
\cite{Intriligator:1996ex},
\cite{deBoer:1996mp},
this
procedure
leads
to
new
sets
of
dual
theories.
For
a
certain
subset
of
dual
theories
which
arise
from
the
aforementioned
M-theory
background
with
an
$A$-type
$\text{ALE}_{1}$
and
a
$D$-type
$\text{ALE}_2$,
we
verify
the
duality
explicitly
by
a
computation
of
partition
functions
of
the
theories
on
$S^3$,
using
localization
techniques
.
We
derive
the
relevant
mirror
map
and
discuss
its
agreement
with
predictions
from
the
Type
IIB
brane
construction
for
these
theories.
