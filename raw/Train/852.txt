we
take

approach.
using
the

deformed
by

terms,
we
explore
charginos,
and
conjecture
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Gross-Stueckelberg,
E_8

are
phenomenological.
in

before
reformulating

deformed

lines,
we
predict
that,
as
will
be
investigated
shortly,
a
magnetic-dual

on

m-folds
can
be
incorporated
into
M-Theory

a
affine
bundle
over
E_7

of

spaces.
thus,
our
results
show
that
general
sheaf
cohomology
is
predictive.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
