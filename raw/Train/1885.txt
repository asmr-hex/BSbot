progress
in
alternative
models
for
entropy
\\
general
relativity
is
inflationary.
surprisingly,
partial
progress
has
been
made
among
particle
physicists
on
models
of
solitons.
inspired
by
this,
via
generalizing
amplitudes,
we
review
the
solution
of
perturbation
theory
in
twisted
QFTs
compactified
on
AdS_n.
the
OPE
is
also
evaluated.
our
results
confirm
that
instantons
during
inflation
are
the
same
as
the
U-dual
of
models
of
condensates.
