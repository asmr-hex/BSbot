a
physical
resolution
of
the
hierarchy
problem
\\
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
technicolor
has
opened
up
a
warped
class
of
thermodynamic
models,
in
the
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
case.
unsurprisingly,
in
the
20th
century,
some
work
was
done
bounding
WZW
extremal
Matrix
Models
supported
on
S^6.
we
take
a
m-dimensional
approach
to
hybrid
effects
in
non-special
lagrangian
brane
models
.
a
B-type
brane
probe
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
is
gauge
mediated
assuming
that
a
BTZ
black
hole
after
reheating
is
effective.
the
flavor
problem
is
superconformal.
thus,
orientifold
planes
are
unified.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
