Hawking
temperature
of
Kerr-Newman-AdS
black
hole
from
tunneling
\\
Using
the
null-geodesic
tunneling
method
of
Parikh
and
Wilczek,
we
derive
the
Hawking
temperature
of
a
general
four-dimensional
rotating
black
hole.
In
order
to
eliminate
the
motion
of
$\phi$
degree
of
freedom
of
a
tunneling
particle,
we
have
chosen
a
reference
system
that
is
co-rotating
with
the
black
hole
horizon.
Then
we
give
the
explicit
result
for
the
Hawking
temperature
of
the
Kerr-Newman-AdS
black
hole
from
the
tunneling
approach.
