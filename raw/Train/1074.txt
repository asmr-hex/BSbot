On
Lovelock
vacuum
solution
\\
We
show
that
the
asymptotic
large
$r$
limit
of
all
Lovelock
vacuum
and
electrovac
solutions
with
$\Lambda$
is
always
the
Einstein
solution
in
$d
\geq
2n+1$
dimensions.
It
is
completely
free
of
the
order
$n$
of
the
Lovelock
polynomial
indicating
universal
asymptotic
behaviour.
