Macroscopic
superpositions
and
black
hole
unitarity
\\
We
discuss
the
black
hole
information
problem,
including
the
recent
claim
that
unitarity
requires
a
horizon
firewall,
emphasizing
the
role
of
decoherence
and
macroscopic
superpositions.
We
consider
the
formation
and
evaporation
of
a
large
black
hole
as
a
quantum
amplitude,
and
note
that
during
intermediate
stages
(e.g.,
after
the
Page
time),
the
amplitude
is
a
superposition
of
macroscopically
distinct
(and
decohered)
spacetimes,
with
the
black
hole
itself
in
different
positions
on
different
branches.
Small
but
semiclassical
observers
(who
are
themselves
part
of
the
quantum
amplitude)
that
fall
into
the
hole
on
one
branch
will
miss
it
entirely
on
other
branches
and
instead
reach
future
infinity.
This
observation
can
reconcile
the
subjective
experience
of
an
infalling
observer
with
unitarity.
We
also
discuss
implications
for
the
nice
slice
formulation
of
the
information
problem,
and
to
complementarity.
