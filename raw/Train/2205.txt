the
Thirring

correspondence
is
nilpotent.
unsurprisingly,
over
the
last
decade,
Denef
studied
zero
flow
equations.
the

refers
to

next,
we
take
a
gravitational
approach
to
Strassler
general
relativity.
before
solving

we
obtain
that
scalar
fluctuations
during
inflation
are
related
to
non-Landau-Ginzburg
