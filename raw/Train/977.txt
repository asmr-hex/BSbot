The
Baxter
Q
Operator
of
Critical
Dense
Polymers
\\
We
consider
critical
dense
polymers
${\cal
L}_{1,2}$,
corresponding
to
a
logarithmic
conformal
field
theory
with
central
charge
$c=-2$.
An
elegant
decomposition
of
the
Baxter
$Q$
operator
is
obtained
in
terms
of
a
finite
number
of
lattice
integrals
of
motion.
All
local,
non
local
and
dual
non
local
involutive
charges
are
introduced
directly
on
the
lattice
and
their
continuum
limit
is
found
to
agree
with
the
expressions
predicted
by
conformal
field
theory.
A
highly
non
trivial
operator
$\Psi(\nu)$
is
introduced
on
the
lattice
taking
values
in
the
Temperley
Lieb
Algebra.
This
$\Psi$
function
provides
a
lattice
discretization
of
the
analogous
function
introduced
by
Bazhanov,
Lukyanov
and
Zamolodchikov.
It
is
also
observed
how
the
eigenvalues
of
the
$Q$
operator
reproduce
the
well
known
spectral
determinant
for
the
harmonic
oscillator
in
the
continuum
scaling
limit.
