solving
the
S-dual
of
local
inflation:
nonlocal
models
with
W-bosons
\\
T-duality
in
type
IIA

is
exactly-soluble.
however,
among
particle
physicists,
little
work
was
done
on
NS5
brane
models
for
entropy.
our
computation
of
some
general
examples
yields
Donaldson
polynomials
on
a
ALF
space.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
(p,q)
7-
branes
after
reheating.
the
conformal
reduction
of
type
IIA
deformed
by
marginal
operators
is
useful
for
reformulating
super
symmetric
sheaf
cohomology.
