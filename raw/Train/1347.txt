Thermodynamics
of
large-$N$
gauge
theories
on
a
sphere:
weak
versus
strong
coupling
\\
Recently
lattice
simulation
in
pure
Yang-Mills
theory
has
exhibited
significant
quadratic
corrections
for
both
the
thermodynamic
quantities
and
the
renormalized
Polyakov
loop
in
the
deconfined
phase.
These
terms
are
previously
found
to
appear
naturally
for
${\mathcal
N}=4$
Super
Yang-Mills
(SYM)
on
a
sphere
at
strong
coupling,
through
the
gauge/string
duality.
Here
we
extend
the
investigation
to
the
weak
coupling
regime,
and
for
general
large-$N$
gauge
theories.
Employing
the
matrix
model
description,
we
find
some
novel
behavior
in
the
deconfined
phase,
which
is
not
noticed
in
the
literature.
Due
to
the
non-uniform
distribution
of
the
eigenvalues,
the
deviation
of
the
Polyakov
loop
from
unity
starts
from
$1/T^3$
instead
of
$1/T^2$.
Such
a
power
is
fixed
by
the
space
dimension
and
do
not
change
with
the
coupling.
This
type
of
deviation
further
induces
odd
temperature
powers
in
the
free
energy,
together
with
logarithmic
factors.
These
are
quite
different
from
the
strong-coupled
${\mathcal
N}=4$
SYM
and
the
lattice
data
for
pure
gauge
theories
in
flat
spacetime.
Based
on
these
observations,
we
conclude
that
the
deconfined
phase
at
weak
coupling
for
large-$N$
gauge
theories
on
a
compact
manifold,
can
not
be
extrapolated
smoothly
to
the
strong
coupling
regime.
Also
one
can
not
smoothly
extend
such
kind
of
phase
to
describe
deconfinement
in
the
flat
spacetime.
