Excluding
Black
Hole
Firewalls
with
Extreme
Cosmic
Censorship
\\
The
AMPS
argument
for
black
hole
firewalls
seems
to
arise
not
only
from
the
assumption
of
local
effective
field
theory
outside
the
stretched
horizon
but
also
from
an
overcounting
of
internal
black
hole
states
that
include
states
that
are
singular
in
the
past.
Here
I
propose
to
exclude
such
singular
states
by
Extreme
Cosmic
Censorship
(the
conjectured
principle
that
the
universe
is
entirely
nonsingular,
except
for
transient
singularities
inside
black
and/or
white
holes).
I
argue
that
the
remaining
set
of
nonsingular
realistic
states
do
not
have
firewalls
but
yet
preserve
information
in
Hawking
radiation
from
black
holes
that
form
from
nonsingular
initial
states.
