Schwarzschild
Geometry
Emerging
from
Matrix
Models
\\
We
demonstrate
how
various
geometries
can
emerge
from
Yang-Mills
type
matrix
models
with
branes,
and
consider
the
examples
of
Schwarzschild
and
Reissner-Nordstroem
geometry.
We
provide
an
explicit
embedding
of
these
branes
in
R^{2,5}
and
R^{4,6},
as
well
as
an
appropriate
Poisson
resp.
symplectic
structure
which
determines
the
non-commutativity
of
space-time.
The
embedding
is
asymptotically
flat
with
asymptotically
constant
\theta^{\mu\nu}
for
large
r,
and
therefore
suitable
for
a
generalization
to
many-body
configurations.
This
is
an
illustration
of
our
previous
work
