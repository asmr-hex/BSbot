among
particle
physicists,
minimal
progress
was
made
on
models
of
bubble
nucleation
in
order
to
prove
that
discussing
nonperturbative
CFTs

is
microscopic.
we
construct
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
topologically
twisted
CFTs
.
we
conjecture
that
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
probe
is
present
as
realized
in
A-type
branes
wrapped
on
non-compact
de
Sitter
Space.
when
obtaining
the
Seiberg-dual
of
QCD
deformed
by
loop
D-terms,
we
discover
that

inflaton
technicolor
is
G_2
symmetric.
