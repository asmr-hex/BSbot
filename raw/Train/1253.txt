We
provide
an
explicit
example
of
a
higher-dimensional
model
describing
a
non-supersymmetric
spectrum
of
4D
particles
of
mass
M,
whose
4D
geometry
--
{\em
including
loop
effects}
--
has
a
curvature
that
is
of
order
R
~
m_KK^4/M_p^2,
where
m_KK
is
the
extra-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein
scale
and
M_p
is
the
4D
Planck
constant.
m_KK
is
stabilized
and
can
in
particular
satisfy
m_KK
&lt;&lt;
M.
The
system
consists
of
a
(5+1)-dimensional
model
with
a
flux-stabilized
supersymmetric
bulk
coupled
to
non-supersymmetric
matter
localized
on
a
(3+1)-dimensional
positive-tension
brane.
We
use
recent
techniques
for
calculating
how
extra
dimensions
respond
to
changes
in
brane
properties
to
show
(at
the
classical
level)
that
the
low-energy
4D
geometry
is
exactly
flat,
independent
of
the
value
of
the
brane
tensions.
Its
mechanism
for
doing
so
is
the
transfer
of
stabilizing
flux
between
the
bulk
and
the
branes.
The
UV
completion
of
the
model
can
arise
at
scales
much
larger
than
M,
allowing
the
calculation
of
quantum
effects
like
the
zero-point
energy
of
very
massive
particles
in
the
vacuum.
We
find
that
brane-localized
loops
do
not
affect
the
4D
curvature
at
all,
but
bulk
loops
can.
These
can
be
estimated
on
general
grounds
and
we
show
that
supersymmetry
dictates
that
they
generate
curvatures
that
are
generically
of
order
m_KK^4/M_p^2.
For
realistic
applications
this
points
to
a
world
with
two
supersymmetric
extra
dimensions,
with
supersymmetry
in
the
bulk
broken
at
the
sub-eV
KK
scale
-
as
proposed
in
