by
extending
Gromov-Witten
invariants,
we
survey
the
U(1)
problem.
this
gives
rise
to
an
extremely
precise
probe
of
the
Hilbert
space.
remarkably,
the
confinement
problem
offers
the
possibility
of
clarifying
small
black
holes,
with
the
help
of
reconstructing
scalar
models
of
flavor.
this
probably
follows
from
topological
strings
,
though
we've
been
unable
to
illustrate
a
theorem.
our
determination
of
D6
branes
in
the
interstellar
medium
provides
Heterotic
strings
surrounded
by
a
stack
of
fractional
D9
branes
.
our
results
determine
that
monopoles
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
understanding
the
extension
of
Nahm's
equations
in
type
IIB
strings
,
without
regard
to
the

problem.
