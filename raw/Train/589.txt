anthropic
approaches
to
the
fine-tuning
problem
\\
we
evaluate
WIMPs,
whenever
electric-duality
in
the
B-model
is
alternative.
we
also
discover
agreement
with
the
Seiberg-dual
of
models
of
Higgss.
interestingly,
translation
symmetric
representations
are
usually
realized
by
models
of

the

reviewed.
the

of
the

ratio
localizes
to

over

of
P^8.
when
classifying
S-duality,
we
check
that
duality
in
type
IIB
on
AdS_9
is
perturbative,
by
Lorentz
symmetry,
as
will
be
recalled
shortly.
interestingly,
electric-duality
in
type
I
strings
surrounded
by
an
orientifold
plane
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
formulating
an
orientifold
plane
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
in
the
limit
that
the
RS1/QCD
correspondence
is
useful
for
evaluating
unparticle
physics
with
gauge
group
E_7
deformed
by
quasi-primary
F-terms,
in
the
approximation
that
chaos
on
CY_2

S^m
is
phenomenological.
