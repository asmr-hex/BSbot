The
St√ºckelberg
Holographic
Superconductors
in
Constant
External
Magnetic
Field
\\
We
investigate
the
St\"{u}ckelberg
holographic
superconductor
in
present
of
the
constant
external
magnetic
field.
We
observe
that
a
critical
value
of
magnetic
field
exists
as
the
cases
in
usual
holographic
superconductor.
Furthermore,
we
find
that
the
applied
magnetic
field
strongly
influence
the
phase
transition
of
this
model
and
have
a
jump
in
the
condensate
at
the
critical
temperature
even
for
$c_{4}=1$.
