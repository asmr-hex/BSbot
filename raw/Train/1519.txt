Stabilisation

Cosmology

\\
This
article
represents
the
author's
PhD
thesis
which
is
focused
on
moduli
stabilisation
in
type
IIB
Calabi-Yau
flux
compactifications
and
its
applications
to
cosmology.
I
derive
the
topological
conditions
on
an
arbitrary
Calabi-Yau
to
give
rise
to
the
very
promising
LARGE
Volume
Scenario.
After
a
systematic
study
of
the
behaviour
of
string
loop
corrections
for
general
type
IIB
compactifications,
I
show
how
they
play
a
crucial
role
to
achieve
full
moduli
stabilisation.
I
then
apply
these
results
to
cosmology
showing
how,
in
the
case
of
K3-fibrations,
string
loop
corrections
give
rise
naturally
to
an
inflationary
model
which
predicts
observable
gravity
waves.
Finally
I
compute
the
decompactification
temperature
for
the
LARGE
Volume
Scenario
due
to
thermal
effects
and
work
out
a
cosmological
constraint
on
the
value
of
the
internal
volume.
