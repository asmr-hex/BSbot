scattering
amplitudes
in
models
of
bubbles
\\
recently,
work
on
models
of
neutrinos
has
opened
up
a
modified
class
of
4-dimensional
models.
we
clarify
why
equivariant
symplectic
quotients
are
warped.
we
completely
demonstrate
a
elegant
correspondence
between
bubbles
at
CDMS
and
localization
in
nonperturbative
unparticle
physics
.
special
lagrangian
branes

are
tachyonic.
thus,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
