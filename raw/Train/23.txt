Coordinate-space
singularities
of
massless
gauge
theories
\\
The
structure
of
singularities
in
perturbative
massless
gauge
theories
is
investigated
in
coordinate
space.
The
pinch
singularities
in
coordinate-space
integrals
occur
at
configurations
of
vertices
which
have
a
direct
interpretation
in
terms
of
physical
scattering
of
particles
in
real
space-time
in
the
same
way
as
for
the
loop
momenta
in
the
case
of
momentum-space
singularities.
In
the
analysis
of
vertex
functions
in
coordinate
space,
the
well-known
factorization
into
hard,
soft,
and
jet
functions
is
found.
By
power-counting
arguments,
it
is
found
that
coordinate-space
integrals
of
vertex
functions
have
logarithmic
divergences
at
worst.
