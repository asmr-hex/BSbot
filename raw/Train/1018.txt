Half-BPS
quotients
in
M-theory:
ADE
with
a
twist
\\
We
classify
Freund-Rubin
backgrounds
of
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
of
the
form
AdS_4
x
X^7
which
are
at
least
half
BPS;
equivalently,
smooth
quotients
of
the
round
7-sphere
by
finite
subgroups
of
SO(8)
which
admit
an
(N&gt;3)-dimensional
subspace
of
Killing
spinors.
The
classification
is
given
in
terms
of
pairs
consisting
of
an
ADE
subgroup
of
SU(2)
and
an
automorphism
defining
its
embedding
in
SO(8).
In
particular
we
find
novel
half-BPS
quotients
associated
with
the
subgroups
of
type
D_n
(for
n&gt;5),
E_7
and
E_8
and
their
outer
automorphisms.
