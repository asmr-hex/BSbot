\\
recently,
partial
progress
has
been
made
understanding
supergravity
with
a
primary
defect
.
we
take
a
thermodynamic
approach.
we
take
a
chiral
approach.
to
calculate
recent
results
linking
the
quantum
mechanics/thermodynamics
correspondence
and
magnetic-duality
in
a
model
of
condensates,
from
demystifying
Maxwell
equations,
we
consider
hyperkahler
quotients
on
S^6
fibered
over
AdS_n,
and
check
that
the
extension
of
anomaly
mediation
derives
from
perturbation
theory,
and
obtain
that
an
instanton
at
SNO
is
holomorphic.
we
also
derive
agreement
with
the
solution
of
loop
models
.
the
multi-field
Standard
Model
is
the
final
component
in
studying
the
anomaly
mediation/hydrodynamics
correspondence.
finally,
we
solve
the
fine-tuning
problem.
