Massive
fermions
and
their
mass
terms
in
2+1
dimensions
\\
We
present
a
first-principle
construction
of
the
massive
fermionic
field
in
2+1
dimensions
using
the
formalism
developed
by
Wigner
and
Weinberg.
The
two-component
fermionic
field
which
furnishes
an
irreducible
representation
of
the
Poincar\'{e}
group
is
shown
to
be
inadequate
to
describe
the
kinematics
of
massive
fermions.
Instead,
a
four-component
field
is
required.
The
field
equation
and
Lagrangian
density
for
the
four-component
field
are
derived
from
purely
symmetry
consideration.
We
find,
for
the
resulting
spinor
QED
and
its
non-Abelian
generalisation,
the
effective
action
at
one-loop
obtained
via
Pauli-Villars
regularisation
no
longer
induce
a
Chern-Simons
term.
The
absence
of
the
Chern-Simons
term
is
explained
by
a
mass
term
in
the
Lagrangian
density
that
has
not
been
considered
before
in
the
literature.
Our
analysis
reveal
that
the
discrete
symmetry
transformations
of
the
field
are
not
unique.
For
each
discrete
operation,
there
are
two
possible
transformations
.
In
both
cases,
the
particles
and
anti-particles
have
even
intrinsic
parities
but
opposite
time-reversal
phases.
The
effect
the
new
mass
term
has
on
the
transition
probability
is
discussed
by
considering
the
Yukawa
interaction.
