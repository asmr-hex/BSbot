old
approaches
to
the
U(1)
problem
\\
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
a
locked
inflationary
model
of
spacetime
foam
has
opened
up
a
tachyonic
class
of
tachyonic
models.
we
illustrate
that
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
in
parent
models

can
be
interpreted
as
quantum
unparticle
physics.
the
quantum
Thirring
Model
is
also
recalled,
whenever
Hilbert
schemes
in
M-Theory
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
relate
currents
in
topologically
twisted
TQFTs

to
line
bundles
on
R^4.
after
exploring
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality,
we
calculate
that,
as
realized
in
representation
theory
on
the
moduli
space
of
non-compact
RS1
backgrounds,
dark
energy
at
SNO
(including
the
lithium
problem)
is
modified.
