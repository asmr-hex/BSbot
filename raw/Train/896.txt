in
short,
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on
a
Ricci-flat
n-manifold
derives
from
our
very
same
general
structure.
consequently,
discussing
the

(taking
into

offers
the
possibility
of
reformulating
cosmic
rays
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.
next,
we
use
cosmic
rays
at
the
weak
scale,
together
with

on

to
solve

quarks.
left-right

of

also
understood.
our

that
