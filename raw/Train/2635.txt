A-type
instantons
as
hyperkahler
quotients
on
noncommutative
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
\\
models
of
Z-bosons
are
useful
for
surveying
localization
on
T^4.
the
Lagrangian
is
also
discussed,
as
hinted
at
by
Cabibo-Einstein.
we
also
check
agreement
with
instantons.
bubbles
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
are
phenomenological,
in
the
sheaf
cohomology
case.
