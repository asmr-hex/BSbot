Refined
Hopf
Link
Revisited
\\
We
establish
a
relation
between
the
refined
Hopf
link
invariant
and
the
S-matrix
of
the
refined
Chern-Simons
theory.
We
show
that
the
refined
open
string
partition
function
corresponding
to
the
Hopf
link,
calculated
using
the
refined
topological
vertex,
when
expressed
in
the
basis
of
Macdonald
polynomials
gives
the
S-matrix
of
the
refined
Chern-Simons
theory.
