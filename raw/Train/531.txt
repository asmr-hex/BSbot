D=4
Extended
Galilei
Superalgebras
with
Central
Charges
\\
We
perform
a
nonrelativistic
contraction
of
N-extended
Poincare
superalgebra
with
internal
symmetry
U(N)
and
general
set
of
N(N-1)
real
central
charges.
We
show
that
for
even
N=2k
and
particular
choice
of
the
dependence
of
Z_{ij}
on
light
velocity
c
one
gets
the
N-extended
Galilei
superalgebra
with
unchanged
number
of
central
charges
and
compact
internal
symmetry
algebra
U(k;H)=USp(2k).
The
Hamiltonian
positivity
condition
is
modified
only
by
one
central
charge.
If
we
put
all
the
central
charges
equal
to
zero
one
gets
the
2k-extended
Galilei
superalgebra
as
the
subalgebra
of
recently
introduced
extended
Galilei
conformal
superalgebra
[1,2].
