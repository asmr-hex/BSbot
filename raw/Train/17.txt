Constraining
non--BPS
interactions
from

\\
The
structure
of
one,
two
and
three
loop
counterterms
imposes
strong
constraints
on
several
non--BPS
interactions
in
the
low
momentum
expansion
of
the
three
loop
four
graviton
amplitude
in
maximal
supergravity.
The
constraints
are
imposed
by
demanding
consistency
with
string
amplitudes.
We
analyze
these
constraints
imposed
on
the
D^8
R^4
interaction
in
11
dimensional
supergravity
compactified
on
T^2.
We
also
discuss
partial
contributions
from
counterterms
to
interactions
at
higher
orders
in
the
momentum
expansion.
