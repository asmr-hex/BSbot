in
this
paper,
in
order
to
avoid
clarifying

TQFTs
,
we
make
contact
with
anomalous
dimensions
in
models
of
special
lagrangian
branes,
fortunately
surveying
the
Hilbert
space.
the
omega
deformation
is
diffractive
supposing
that
nontrivial
currents
can
be
interpreted
as
unitarity
in
Topological
String
Theory
on
P^n.
our
results
illustrate
that
U-duality
in
holographic
models
with
dions
is
tachyonic.
consequently,
partition
functions
follow
from
supergravity
with
a
multi-fermion
defect
living
on
exotic
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
(including
String
Theory
on
CY_n).
surprisingly,
recently,
Fermi
calculated
that
a
stack
of
(p,q)
7-
branes
wrapping
a
dS_n
(taking
into
account
canonical
singularities
at
DAMA)
is
transverse.
we
check
that
a
small
black
hole
exists
whenever
the
U(1)
problem
is
unconventional.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Bogoliubov.
