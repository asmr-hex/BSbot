Quantum
spectral
dimension
in
quantum
field
theory
\\
We
reinterpret
the
spectral
dimension
of
spacetimes
as
the
scaling
of
an
effective
self-energy
transition
amplitude
in
quantum
field
theory,
when
the
system
is
probed
at
a
given
resolution.
This
picture
has
three
main
advantages:
(a)
it
clarifies
the
role
of
the
mass
term
in
the
derivation
of
the
spectral
dimension;
(b)
it
dispenses
with
the
usual
interpretation
(unsatisfactory
in
covariant
approaches)
where
instead
of
a
transition
amplitude
one
has
a
probability
density
solving
a
non-relativistic
diffusion
equation
in
an
abstract
diffusion
time;
(c)
it
solves
the
problem
of
negative
probabilities
known
for
higher-order
and
non-local
dispersion
relations
in
classical
and
quantum
gravity;
(d)
it
clarifies
the
concept
of
quantum
spectral
dimension
as
opposed
to
the
classical
one.
We
then
consider
a
class
of
logarithmic
dispersion
relations
associated
with
quantum
particles
and
show
that
the
spectral
dimension
$d_s$
of
spacetime
as
felt
by
these
quantum
probes
can
deviate
from
its
classical
value,
equal
to
the
topological
dimension
$D$.
In
particular,
in
the
presence
of
higher
momentum
powers
it
changes
with
the
scale,
dropping
from
$D$
in
the
infrared
(IR)
to
a
value
$d_s^{\rm
UV}\leq
D$
in
the
ultraviolet
(UV).
We
apply
this
general
result
to
Stelle
theory
of
renormalizable
gravity,
which
attains
the
universal
value
$d_s^{\rm
UV}=2$
for
any
dimension
$D$.
