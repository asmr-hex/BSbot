The
Verlinde
formula
in
logarithmic
CFT
\\
In
rational
conformal
field
theory,
the
Verlinde
formula
computes
the
fusion
coefficients
from
the
modular
S-transformations
of
the
characters
of
the
chiral
algebra's
representations.
Generalising
this
formula
to
logarithmic
models
has
proven
rather
difficult
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
Here,
a
recently
proposed
formalism
(
