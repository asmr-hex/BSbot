gives
a
profound
framework
for
demystifying
braneworld
hierarchies
in
String
theories
on
R^n
fibered
over
the
moduli
space
of
Calabi-Yau
n-folds.
we
obtain
evidence
for
Schwarzschild
black
holes.
this
probably
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
certain
notion
of
localization,
though
we've
been
unable
to
prove
a
conjecture.
our
results
determine
that
an
orientifold
plane
at
the
intermediate
scale
is
related
to
the
extension
of
U-duality
in
models
of
instanton
liquids.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
