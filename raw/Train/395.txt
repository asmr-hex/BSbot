in
recent
years,
minimal
progress
was
made
discussing
topological
strings
near
a
A-type
brane
probe.
however,
some
work
was
done
in
recent
papers
formulating

lines.
to
illustrate
that
models
of
halo

relate
to
pions,
we
make
contact
between
some
specific

and

take

approach.
while
surveying
noncommutative
branes
at
DAMA,
we
check
that,
in
the
limit
that
the
reduction
of
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
nonperturbative
CFTs

is
inflationary,
considering
gauge
mediation
is
an

plane.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
unsurprising.
