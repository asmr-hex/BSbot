in
recent
years,
Dyson

orientifold

let
us
understand
the
holographic
compactification
of
models
of
instanton
liquids.
using
the
behavior
of
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition,
we
reformulate
a
minimal
solution
to
the
strong
CP
problem
from
flavor
at
the
LHC.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
m-point
correlators
in
String
Theory
far
from
(p,q)
instantons.
when
investigating
unitarity
in
type
IIA
strings
,
we
check
that
a
E_8
extension
of
models
of
spacetime
foam
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
considering
T-duality
in
supersymmetric
TQFTs
on
F_4
orbifolds
of
hyper-Kahler
Calabi-Yau
m-folds
fibered
over
a
projective
K3.
