We
analyse
the
triviality-quantum
decoherence
of
Euclidean
quantum
chromodynamics
in
the
gauge
invariant
sector
in
the
presence
of
an
external
U(infinite)-flavor
constant
charged
white
noise
reservoir
and
producing
thus
a
proof
for
confinement
in
the
Color-charge
QCD
through
the
modeling
of
the
QCD
vacuum
by
constant
gauge
fields
