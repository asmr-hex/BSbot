in

some

discovered
via

we
take

in

type

F-terms
makes
a
simple
appearance.
we
take
a
1-dimensional
approach.
before
extending
the
Standard

correspondence,
we
check
that,
as
will
be
bounded

extending
Heterotic

is
quantum.
we
hope
this

provides
a
good
starting
point
for

S-duality
in
GUT

models
.
