The
Tensor
Theory
Space
\\
The
tensor
track
is
a
background-independent
discretization
of
quantum
gravity
which
includes
a
sum
over
all
topologies.
We
discuss
how
to
define
a
functional
renormalization
group
flow
and
the
Wetterich
equation
in
the
corresponding
theory
space.
This
space
is
different
from
the
Einsteinian
theory
space
of
asymptotic
safety.
It
includes
all
fixed-rank
tensor-invariant
interactions,
hence
generalizes
matrix
models
and
the
(Moyal)
non-commutative
field
theory
space.
