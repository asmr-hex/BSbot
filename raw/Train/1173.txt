On
the
Minimal
Length
Uncertainty
Relation
and
the
Foundations
of
String
Theory
\\
We
review
our
work
on
the
minimal
length
uncertainty
relation
as
suggested
by
perturbative
string
theory.
We
discuss
simple
phenomenological
implications
of
the
minimal
length
uncertainty
relation
and
then
argue
that
the
combination
of
the
principles
of
quantum
theory
and
general
relativity
allow
for
a
dynamical
energy-momentum
space.
We
discuss
the
implication
of
this
for
the
problem
of
vacuum
energy
and
the
foundations
of
non-perturbative
string
theory.
