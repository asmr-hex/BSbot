The
Quantum
Closet
\\
The
equivalence
postulate
approach
to
quantum
mechanics
entails
a
derivation
of
quantum
mechanics
from
a
fundamental
geometrical
principle.
Underlying
the
formalism
there
exists
a
basic
cocycle
condition,
which
is
invariant
under
D-dimensional
finite
Mobius
transformations.
The
invariance
of
the
cocycle
condition
under
finite
Mobius
transformations
implies
that
space
is
compact.
Additionally,
it
implies
energy
quantisation
and
the
undefinability
of
quantum
trajectories.
I
argue
that
the
decompactification
limit
coincides
with
the
classical
limit.
Evidence
for
the
compactness
of
the
universe
may
exist
in
the
Cosmic
Microwave
Background
Radiation.
