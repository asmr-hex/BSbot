Mathieu
twining
characters
for
K3
\\
The
analogue
of
the
McKay-Thompson
series
for
the
proposed
Mathieu
group
action
on
the
elliptic
genus
of
K3
is
analysed.
The
corresponding
NS-sector
twining
characters
have
good
modular
properties
and
satisfy
remarkable
replication
identities.
These
observations
provide
strong
support
for
the
conjecture
that
the
elliptic
genus
of
K3
carries
indeed
an
action
of
the
Mathieu
group
M24.
