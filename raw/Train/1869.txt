Noneuclidean
Tessellations
and
their
relation
to
Reggie
Trajectories
\\
The
coefficients
in
the
confluent
hypergeometric
equation
specify
the
Regge
trajectories
and
the
degeneracy
of
the
angular
momentum
states.
Bound
states
are
associated
with
real
angular
momenta
while
resonances
are
characterized
by
complex
angular
momenta.
With
a
centrifugal
potential,
the
half-plane
is
tessellated
by
crescents.
The
addition
of
an
electrostatic
potential
converts
it
into
a
hydrogen
atom,
and
the
crescents
into
triangles
which
may
have
complex
conjugate
angles;
the
angle
through
which
a
rotation
takes
place
is
accompanied
by
a
stretching.
Rather
than
studying
the
properties
of
the
wave
functions
themselves,
we
study
their
symmetry
groups.
A
complex
angle
indicates
that
the
group
contains
loxodromic
elements.
Since
the
domain
of
such
groups
is
not
the
disc,
hyperbolic
plane
geometry
cannot
be
used.
Rather,
the
theory
of
the
isometric
circle
is
adapted
since
it
treats
all
groups
symmetrically.
The
pairing
of
circles
and
their
inverses
is
likened
to
pairing
particles
with
their
antiparticles
which
then
go
one
to
produce
nested
circles,
or
a
proliferation
of
particles.
A
corollary
to
Laguerre's
theorem,
which
states
that
the
euclidean
angle
is
represented
by
a
pure
imaginary
projective
invariant,
represents
the
imaginary
angle
in
the
form
of
a
real
projective
invariant.
