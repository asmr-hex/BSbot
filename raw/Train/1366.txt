Equivariant
Reduction
of
U(4)
Gauge
Theory
over
S_F^2
x
S_F^2
and
the
Emergent
Vortices
\\
We
consider
a
U(4)
Yang-Mills
theory
on
M
x
S_F^2
x
S_F^2
where
M
is
an
arbitrary
Riemannian
manifold
and
S_F^2
x
S_F^2
is
the
product
of
two
fuzzy
spheres
spontaneously
generated
from
a
SU(\cal
{N})
Yang-Mills
theory
on
M
which
is
suitably
coupled
to
six
scalars
in
the
adjoint
of
SU({\cal
N}).
We
determine
the
SU(2)
x
SU(2)-equivariant
U(4)
gauge
fields
and
perform
the
dimensional
reduction
of
the
theory
over
S_F^2
x
S_F^2.
The
emergent
model
is
a
U(1)^4
gauge
theory
coupled
to
four
complex
and
eight
real
scalar
fields.
We
study
this
theory
on
R_2
and
find
that,
in
certain
limits,
it
admits
vortex
type
solutions
with
U(1)^3
gauge
symmetry
and
discuss
some
of
their
properties.
