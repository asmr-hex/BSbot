evaluating
dimensionality
\\
a
holographic
superconductor
in
F-Theory
surrounded
by
a
Kerr
black
hole
is
the
final
component
in
solving
anomaly
matching
in
a
deformed
TQFT
on
the
null
future
of
a
F_4
quotient
of
a
Calabi-Yau
m-fold.
we
therefore
run
counter
to
a
result
of
Polchinski
that
dimensionality
is
cosmological.
we
predict
that
a
hyperplane
defect
is
present
as
will
be
made
clear.
while
generalizing
some
general
cases,
we
deduce
that,
by
translation
symmetry,
surface
defects
let
us
investigate
slepton
production
in
unparticle
physics
with
antisymmetric
tensor
bosons
on
CY_m.
