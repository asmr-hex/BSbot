in
recent
papers,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
investigating
type
I
strings
.
we
use
examples
of
the
nPI
effective
action
in
models
of
pions,
together
with
Nekrosov
equations
on
\Z^m
bundles
over
CY_m
to
calculate
fractional
D1
instantons,
and
obtain
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
zero
structures
in
M-Theory
in
the
presence
of
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
,
a
compactification
of
Bohr-'t
Hooft
points
in
Toda
Yang-Mills
Theorys
on
R^m
is
general.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
charges
in
Toda
CFTs
compactified
on
de
Sitter
Space.
before
analyzing
trivial
symplectic
quotients,
we
obtain
that,
in
the
dimensionality
case,
Poincare
algebras
relate
to

CFTs
living
on
Einstein
rational
surfaces.
