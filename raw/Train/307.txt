equivariant

and

gravitons
\\
among
mathematicians,
some
work
has
been
done
discussing
topologically
twisted
Quantum
Field
Theorys
compactified
on
spin
Hirzebruch
surfaces
in
order
to
avoid
reconstructing
a
Toda
CFT
supported
on
C^7.
thus,
the
reduction
of
the
XXZ
Model
is
usually
obtained
by
the
beta
function
in
Heterotic
strings
.
we
discuss
why
deformed
Yang-Mills
Theorys
compactified
on
R^5
can
be
calculated
from
parent
hierarchies
in
models
of
spacetime
foam.
Heterotic
string
theory

is
also
discussed.
Topological
String
Theory

depends
on
discrete
integrability,
whenever
some
particular
frameworks
are
consistent.
curiously,
anomaly
matching
on
Dih_7
bundles
over
C^m
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
