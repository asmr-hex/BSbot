a
analytic
continuation
of
anomaly
matching
in
models
of
electrons
\\
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
C^n
yields
a
startling
framework
for
classifying
solutions.
in
this
paper,
we
shed
light
on
bubbles
after
reheating,
ultimately
demystifying
that
SU(9)
models
for
topological
defect
general
inflation
can
be
interpreted
as
supersymmetric
models
for
bubble
nucleation.
we
also
derive
agreement
with
the
gauge
mediation/gauge
mediation
correspondence.
when
explaining
zero
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants,
we
check
that
a
model
of
bubble
nucleation
(excluding
abelian
Spin(m)
symmetric
structure)
derives
from
nonzero
chaos.
