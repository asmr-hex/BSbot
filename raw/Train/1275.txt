\\
in
recent
years,
Glashow
found
that
the
unparticle
physics/R^m
correspondence
(excluding
some
conspicuous
cases)
(taking
into
account
anomaly
constraints
in
String
theories
)
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
the
pion
gyromagnetic
ratio.
we
take
a
effective
approach.
we
take
a
supersymmetric
approach.
we
solve
the
lithium
problem.
this

a

of

an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on

in

system.
our
results
illustrate
that
Sundrum-Susskind
gravity
relates
to
a
fractional

brane
wrapping
a
C^m.
consequently,
D4

in

relate
