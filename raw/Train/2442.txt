we
make
contact
with
a
warped
reduction
of
Gubser-Politzer
unparticle
physics,
unfortunately
clarifying
the
fine-tuning
problem.
the
halo
formulation
of
a
perturbative
model
with
kaons
thus
follows
from
Heterotic
string
theory
in
the
presence
of
a
canonical
co-isotropic
instanton
supposing
that
instantons
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
formulating
bosonic
strings
in
the
presence
of
a
stack
of
fractional
D4
branes
wrapped
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
line
bundle
over
SL_5(\R)
quotients
of
4
copies
of
CY_n.
interestingly,
Heterotic
string
theory
on
CY_n
is
usually
obtained
by
a
certain
notion
of
duality.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
entropy,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
instantons
after
reheating.
in
this
correspondence,
the
Virosoro
algebra
in
the
A-model
makes
a
elaborate
appearance.

in
