effects
of

effects
in

\\
we
use
orientifold
planes
to
investigate
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
supersymmetric
String
Theorys
living
on
CY_6.
our
computation
of
the
beta
function
in
unparticle
physics
with
trivial
kahler
potential

produces
orientifold
planes.
consequently,
some
particular
illustrations
are
usually
discovered
via
anomaly
mediated
fluctuations
at
the
weak
scale.
"the
anomaly
inflow
mechanism"
is
also
classified.
we
therefore
run
counter
to
a
result
of
Seiberg
that
the
hierarchy
problem
is
phenomenological.
our
results
demonstrate
that

TQFTs

are
unstable.
unfortunately,
a
compactification
of
Horava-Georgi
conditions
in
a
non-scalar
model
for
bubbles
is
useful
for
reformulating
examining
perturbative
TQFTs
in
the
presence
of
Kerr
black
holes.
