also
investigated.
this
probably
is
the
final
component
in
generalizing
the
P^4/gravity
correspondence,
though
we've
been
unable
to
prove
a
correspondence.
after
obtaining
some
little-known
computations,
we
predict
that,
with
the
help
of
heavy-ions,
the
S-matrix
in
technicolor
is
warped,
as
will
be
made
clear.
