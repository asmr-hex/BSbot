Quantum
field
theory
in
curved
graphene
spacetimes,
Lobachevsky
geometry,
Weyl
symmetry,
Hawking
effect,
and
all
that
\\
We
extensively
discuss
the
theoretical
framework
to
make
curved
monolayer
graphene
a
realization
of
quantum
field
theory
in
curved
spacetime.
We
rely
upon
a
model
of
the
electron-phonon
interaction
that
reproduces
the
standard
semiclassical
Dirac
quantum
field
in
a
curved
spacetime.
This
model
holds
for
very
long
wavelengths
of
the
graphene
conductivity
electrons
involved.
Provided
the
full
description
of
the
phonon-electron
interaction
is
of
a
modified
gravity-type,
the
core
of
the
results
presented
here
apply,
with
due
changes,
to
that
case
too.
Using
local
Weyl
symmetry,
we
probe
into
the
possibility
to
reproduce
a
Hawking
effect.
For
the
sake
of
making
the
test
easier
in
a
laboratory,
the
whole
study
is
carried
out
for
the
case
of
purely
spatial
curvatures,
and
for
conformally
flat
spacetimes.
Since
we
show
that
for
the
sphere
there
is
no
intrinsic
horizon,
the
focus
is
on
the
infinite
different
surfaces
of
constant
negative
Gaussian
curvature.
Even
though,
in
those
cases,
deep
reasons
of
Lobachevsky
geometry
seem
to
lead
to
unreachable
event
horizons,
we
show
under
which
conditions
the
horizon
is
within
reach.
The
Hawking
effect,
then,
takes
place
on
the
Beltrami
surface.
We
also
explicitly
study
the
spacetimes
of
the
other
two
pseudospheres,
and
show
their
relation
to
de
Sitter,
and
BTZ
black-hole
spacetimes.
In
the
same
limit
that
gives
a
reachable
event
horizon,
these
two
cases,
essentially,
reduce
to
Beltrami.
This,
together
with
the
fact
that
all
the
infinite
surfaces
in
point
are
applicable
to
either
one
of
the
three
pseudospheres,
make
us
conjecture
about
the
possibility
for
a
Hawking
effect
for
a
generic
surface
of
the
family.
The
Hawking
effect
here
manifests
itself
through
a
finite
(Hawking)
temperature
electronic
local
density
of
states,
that
we
exhibit.
