\\
The
localized
fermions
on
the
intersection
curve
$\Sigma$
of
D7-branes,
are
connected
to
a
N=2
supersymmetric
quantum
mechanics
algebra.
Due
to
this
algebra
the
fields
obey
a
global
U(1)
symmetry.
This
symmetry
restricts
the
proton
decay
operators
and
the
neutrino
mass
terms.
Particularly,
we
find
that
several
proton
decay
operators
are
forbidden
and
the
Majorana
mass
term
is
the
only
one
allowed
in
the
theory.
A
special
SUSY
QM
algebra
is
studied
at
the
end
of
the
paper.
In
addition
we
study
the
impact
of
a
non-trivial
holomorphic
metric
perturbation
on
the
localized
solutions
along
each
matter
curve.
Moreover,
we
study
the
connection
of
the
localized
solutions
to
an
N=2
supersymmetric
quantum
mechanics
algebra
when
background
fluxes
are
turned
on.
