Highly
Effective
Actions
\\
It
is
conjectured
that
the
world-volume
action
of
a
probe
D3-brane
in
an
$AdS_5
\times
S^5$
background
of
type
IIB
superstring
theory,
with
one
unit
of
flux,
can
be
reinterpreted
as
the
exact
effective
action
(or
highly
effective
action)
for
U(2),
${\cal
N}
=
4$
super
Yang-Mills
theory
on
the
Coulomb
branch.
An
analogous
conjecture
for
$U(2)_k
\times
U(2)_{-k}
$
ABJM
theory
is
also
presented.
The
main
evidence
supporting
these
conjectures
is
that
the
brane
actions
have
all
of
the
expected
symmetries
and
dualities.
Highly
effective
actions
have
general
coordinate
invariance,
even
though
they
describe
nongravitational
theories.
