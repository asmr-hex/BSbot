Black
holes
with
a
null
Killing
vector
in
three-dimensional
massive
gravity
\\
We
investigate
solutions
of
new
massive
gravity
with
two
commuting
Killing
vectors,
one
of
which
is
null,
with
a
special
emphasis
on
black
hole
solutions.
Besides
extreme
BTZ
black
holes
and,
for
a
special
value
of
the
coupling
constant,
massless
null
warped
black
holes,
we
also
obtain
for
a
critical
coupling
a
family
of
massive
"log"
black
holes.
These
are
asymptotic
to
the
extreme
BTZ
black
holes
in
the
sense
of
log
gravity.
