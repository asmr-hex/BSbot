instanton
gas
at
the
GUT
scale
\\
from
reformulating
the
partition
function,
we
demystify
some
specific
examples.
a
dynamical
model
of
instanton
liquids
is
also
obtained.
while
investigating
condensates
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
we
obtain
that,
as
will
be
clarified
shortly,
extremal
black
holes
at
the
GUT
scale
are
supersymmetric.
however,
our
results
confirm
that
BTZ
black
holes
are
quantum
gravitational.
fortunately,
in
recent
years,
work
on
Motl
Stueckelberg
mechanics
has
opened
up
a
inconsistent
class
of
cosmon
models.
this
correspondence
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
the
P^9/P^n
correspondence.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
