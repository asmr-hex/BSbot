classifying
the
QCD/technicolor
correspondence:
a

superconductor
in
anthropic
models
for
bubbles
\\
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
recently
on
models
of
viable
inflation.
we
make
contact
with
discrete
discrete
structures,
unsurprisingly
classifying

RS1.
we
therefore
challenge
a
result
of
Denef
that
flow
equations
in
type
I
strings

can
be
discovered
from
solving
models
of
quantum
fluctuations.
before

of

in

with

lines
,
we
deduce
that
the
Wilsonian
effective
action
can
be
obtained
from
perturbation
theory,
as
realized
in
the
strong
CP
problem.
fortunately,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
