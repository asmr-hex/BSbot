\\
We
show
that
Abelian
discrete
symmetries
Z_{N}
and
Z_{nR}
from
string
orbifolds
result
by
assigning
vacuum
expectation
values(VEVs)
only
to
specified
singlets.
These
singlets
obtaining
VEVs
carry
the
gauge
charges
(of
the
covering
U(1)
gauge
group)
as
multiples
of
N
for
Z_N
and
n
for
Z_{nR}.
We
explicitly
show
this
realization
in
a
Z_{12-I}
orbifold
model.
