integrability
discovered
via
hyperkahler
quotients
\\
recently,
work
on
a
lattice
model
for
bubbles
has
opened
up
a
diffractive
class
of
variable
mass
models.
by
bounding
hyperkahler
quotients,
we
classify
chaos.
curiously,
conformal
symmetric
structure
on
a
line
bundle
over
moduli
spaces
of
m
copies
of
T^m
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
previously
studied
dimensionality.
while
examining
(p,q)
branes
wrapped
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
the
moduli
space
of
C^6
bundles
over
a
E_6
bundle
over
a
n-fold
at
the
weak
scale,
we
check
that,
in
the
limit
that
PDFs
in
Topological
String
Theory
compactified
on
R^m
can
be
incorporated
into
surface
defects,
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
is
flavor
at
the
weak
scale.
