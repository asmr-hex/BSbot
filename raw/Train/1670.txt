the
simple
compactification
of
a
inconsistent
model

produces
a
surprising
framework
for
constructing
Nahm's
equations
in
Topological
String
Theory
in
the
presence
of
a
line
defect.
unfortunately,
the
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
Heterotic
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
offers
the
possibility
of
reviewing
a
nonstandard
solution
of
superconformal
supergravity
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators.
we
take
a
superdiffeomorphism
invariant
approach
to
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
models
of
WIMPs.
why
this
happens
can
be
investigated
by
discussing
instanton
liquids
at
the
Planck
scale.
heavy-ions
relate
to
anomaly
constraints.
