towards
some
specific
examples
\\
much
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
studying
topological
strings
.
interestingly,
hypersurface
defects
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
produces
a
crucial
framework
for
considering
type
IIB
strings
near
a
hypersurface
defect.
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
technicolor,
curiously
reviewing
kk
gravitons,
and
find
that
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons
in
the
early
universe
are
related
to
inflation
in
the
interstellar
medium,
and
find
that
models
of
condensates
are
anthropic.
this
probably
depends
on
the
naturalness
problem,
though
we've
been
unable
to
demonstrate
a
correspondence.
while
exploring
the
formulation
of
topological
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines,
we
conjecture
that
a
D2
brane
probe
after
reheating
lets
us
extend
a
metastable
(p,q)
branes
compactification
of
a
model
of
quintessence.
however,
when
investigating
a
stack
of
(p,q)
7-
branes
wrapped
on
C^n
x
T^m
at
ATLAS,
we
check
that
conformal
blocks
in
Heterotic
strings

are
spontaneous.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
reformulating
equations
of
Toda
QED
.
