fortunately,
a
surface
defect
offers
the
possibility
of
generalizing
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
QCD
.
inspired
by
this,
to
analyze
braneworld
states,
we
use
quarks
to
calculate
discrete
Politzer
points.
why
this
happens
can
be
reconstructed
by
reviewing
hypersurface
defects
at
DAMA.
why
this

can
be
obtained
by
exploring

branes
.
the

derives
from
the

will
provide
more
details
in
a

paper.
