Exact
fermionic
Green's
functions
from
holograpny
\\
We
construct
a
series
of
charged
dilatonic
black
holes
which
share
zero
entropy
in
the
zero
temperature
limit
using
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
theories.
In
these
black
holes,
the
wave
functions
and
the
Green's
functions
of
massless
fermions
can
be
solved
exactly
in
terms
of
special
functions
in
the
phase
space
of
$(\omega,k)$.
We
observe
that
for
sufficiently
large
charge,
there
are
many
poles
in
the
Green's
function
with
vanishing
$\omega$,
which
strongly
signifies
that
Fermi
surfaces
exist
in
these
holographic
systems.
The
new
distinguishing
properties
of
the
Green's
function
arising
in
these
systems
were
illustrated
with
great
details.
We
also
study
the
poles
motion
of
the
Green's
function
for
arbitrary
(complex)
frequency.
Our
analytic
results
provide
a
more
realistic
and
elegant
approach
to
study
strongly
correlated
fermionic
systems
using
gauge/gravity
duality.
