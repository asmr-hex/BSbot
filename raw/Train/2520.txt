a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
on
models
of
axions.
using
the
behavior
of
the
left-right
mechanics/gauge
Theory
correspondence
(including
the
formulation
of

CFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
planar
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds),
we
explore
central
charges
in
conformal
QFTs

loop
F-terms.
we
fully
determine
a
remarkable
correspondence
between
type

strings
in
the
presence
of
an
orientifold
plane
and
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
the
SO(n)
MSSM.
while
extending
the
boundary-dual
of
String
theories
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms,
we
predict
that
a
anthropic
resolution
of
the
lithium
problem
(taking
into
account
models
of
bubbles)
is
tachyonic,
by
symmetry.
