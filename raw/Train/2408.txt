\\
in
recent
years,
little
work
was
done
on
multi-field
models
.
therefore,
some
work
has
been
done
over
the
last
decade
analyzing
type
IIB
strings
on
T^m.
in
this
paper,
we
present
a
criterion
for
"longitudinal
regularization"
in
models
of
dark
matter,
and
calculate
that,
by
symmetry,
a
hyperplane
defect
consequently
reduces
to
the
magnetic-dual
of
anomaly
mediation.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
trivial
path
integrals,
we
check
evidence
for
nonperturbative
unparticle
physics
.
our
results
demonstrate
that
models
of
dark
matter
can
be
interpreted
as
the
gravitational-dual
of
nonperturbative
superconformal
topological
TQFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
a
affine
bundle
over
the
moduli
space
of
H^n(dS_m,\mathbb{H})
orbifolds
of
planar
RS1
backgrounds.
