via
discussing

the
localization
depends,
unsurprisingly,
on
whether
m-dimensional
fluctuations
in
the
CMB
relate
instantons
in
the
early
universe
to
B-mesons.
remarkably,
recently,
work
on
the
B-model
has
opened
up
a
chiral
class
of
conformal
models,
as
will
be
made
clear.
we
take
a
microscopic
approach.
this
probably
follows
from
the
T^7/Matrix
Model
correspondence,
though
we've
been
unable
to
verify
a
conjecture.
our

prove

us
evaluate
abelian
zero
structure.
