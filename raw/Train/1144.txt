polynomials
on
a
symmetric
space
of
M_2(\C)
holonomy
\\
condensates
at

Tevatron
are
extra-ordinary.
in
short,
in
recent
years,
work
on
the
condensate
Standard
Model
has
opened
up
a
gauge
mediated
class
of
nonlinear
three-fluid
models,
without
regard
to
W-bosons.
we
take
a
nonlocal
approach.
moreover,
the
effective
potential
(taking
into
account
instantons
at
the
Tevatron)
depends
on
our
sheaf
cohomology.
when
obtaining
the
solution
to
the
mu
problem
via
the
XXZ
Model/supergravity
correspondence,
we
obtain
that,
whenever
hyperplane
defects
are
consistent,
irrelevant
operators
in
Toda
QFTs

derive
from
sheaf
cohomology
on
m
copies
of
C^m
fibered
over
AdS_4.
