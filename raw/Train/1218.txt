Spinning
Dilaton
Black

+1
Dimensions:
Quasi-normal

and
the

\\
We
have
studied
the
perturbation
of
a
spinning
dilaton
black
hole
in
2
+1
dimensions
by
a
massless
scalar
field.
The
wave
equations
of
a
massless
scalar
field
is
shown
to
be
exactly
solvable
in
terms
of
hypergeometric
functions.
The
quasinormal
frequencies
are
computed
for
slowly
spinning
black
holes.
The
stability
of
the
black
hole
is
discussed.
The
asymptotic
form
of
the
quasinormal
frequencies
are
evaluated.
The
area
spectrum
of
the
quantum
black
holes
are
evaluated
by
using
the
asymptotic
quasi-normal
frequencies
and
is
shown
to
be
equally-spaced.
