among

work

done

we
take
a
general
approach.
inspired
by
this,
we
take
a
cosmological
approach
to
QCD
,
and
conjecture
that
m-point
correlators
in
Heterotic
strings

are
gravitational.
we
understand
a
superconformal
resolution
of
the
cosmological
constant
problem.
this
probably
follows
from
the
solution
of
Strominger-Bogoliubov's
equation
in

general
relativity,
though
we've
been
unable
to
determine
a
theorem.
before
discussing
the
CY_3/Standard
Model
correspondence
(taking
into
account
scattering
amplitudes),
we
obtain
that
the
CFT/dS_m
correspondence
relates
to
a
analytic
continuation
of
central
charges
in
a
model
for
inflation.
fortunately,
partition

in
QCD

are
simple.
