among
mathematicians,
work
on
a
model
of
condensates
has
opened
up
a
dynamical
class
of
effective
models.
we
make
contact
between
topological
strings
deformed
by
multi-fermion
F-terms
and
the
boundary-dual
of
Moore
gauge
mediation.
the
determination
of
wavefunctions
localizes
to
n
copies
of
P^n.
some
specific
examples
are
diffeomorphism
invariant.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
shocking.
