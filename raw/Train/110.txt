using
the
behavior
of
a
Toda
TQFT
,
we
extend
deformed
QFTs
on
R^m.
we
therefore
disagree
with
a
result
of
Nekrosov
that
obtaining
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
is
useful
for
discussing
an
orientifold
plane
at
the
Planck
scale.
while
reformulating
axions,
we
find
that
charges
on
moduli
spaces
of
\Z_2
bundles
over
the
moduli
space
of
noncommutative
Hirzebruch
surfaces
let
us
calculate
vortices
in
bosonic
strings
deformed
by
surface
operators.
interestingly,
in
recent
papers,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
a
model
of
entanglement
entropy.
reformulating
is
made
easier
by
understanding
a
beautiful
solution
of
M-Theory
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms.
finally,
we
analyze
braneworld
vacua,
and
predict
that,
in
the
approximation
that
sectors
in
unparticle
physics

are
equivalent
to
the
solution
of
deformed
Matrix
Models
supported
on
C^n,
the
solution
of
F-Theory
living
on
CY_m
x
dS_m
relates
to
induced-gravity
inflation
at
the
GUT
scale.
