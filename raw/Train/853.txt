Entanglement
Entropy
in
Non-Relativistic
Field
Theories
\\
We
calculate
entanglement
entropy
in
a
non-relativistic
field
theory
described
by
the
Schr\"odinger
operator.
We
demonstrate
that
the
entropy
is
characterized
by
i)
the
area
law
and
ii)
UV
divergences
that
are
identical
to
those
in
the
relativistic
field
theory.
These
observations
are
further
supported
by
a
holographic
consideration.
We
use
the
non-relativistic
symmetry
and
completely
specify
entanglement
entropy
in
large
class
of
non-relativistic
theories
described
by
the
field
operators
polynomial
in
derivatives.
We
suggest
that
the
area
law
of
the
entropy
can
be
tested
in
experiments
with
condensed
matter
systems
such
as
liquid
helium.
