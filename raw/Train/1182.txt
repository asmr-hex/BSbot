on
Light-like
Tachyon
Condensation
\\
In
this
paper
closed
string
emission
and
open
string
pair
production
from
the
light-like
rolling
tachyon
solution
are
calculated
in
subcritical
string
theory
in
the
background
of
a
linear
dilaton.
The
rolling
light-like
tachyon
represents
the
inhomogeneous
decay
of
unstable
D-brane.
The
decay
rate
is
given
by
the
imaginary
part
of
annulus
diagram
which
can
be
calculated
using
the
boundary
state/sigma-model
method.
It
is
found
that
the
decay
rate
is
finite
in
the
open
string
ultraviolet
region
and
depends
on
tachyon
profile
in
the
open
string
infrared
region.
