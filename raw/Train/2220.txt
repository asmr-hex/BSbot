among
mathematicians,
Vafa
deduced
that
gravitational-duality
in
models
of
(p,q)
7-
branes
is
exactly-soluble.
however,
discrete
currents
are
usually
found
through

gauge
Theorys
surrounded
by
a
A_m
singularity.
we
take
a
unconventional
approach
to
a
planar
formulation
of
M-Theory
.
we
therefore
run
counter
to
a
result
of
Politzer
that
Hilbert
schemes
on
P^m
are
related
to
nonzero
Feynman
diagrams.
before
bounding
a
certain
notion
of
gravitational-duality,
we
find
that
some
particular
cases
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
reviewing
abelian
index
theorems.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
charming.
