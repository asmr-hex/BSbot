The
NUT
in
the
N=2
Superalgebra
\\
We
study
how
the
supersymmetry
algebra
extension
of
N=2
supergravity
with
central
charges
describes
the
NUT
charge
in
a
duality-covariant
way.
The
stationary
BPS
states
of
N=2
supergravity
can
be
embedded
in
the
flat
space
solution
of
the
timelike
reduced
theory.
Upon
reduction,
the
Killing
superalgebra
extension
and
the
global
superalgebra
of
charges
are
described
covariantly
under
the
coset
structure
of
the
three-dimensional
theory.
The
integral
of
the
Nester-Witten
form
given
by
Gibbons
and
Hull
for
N=2
has
a
covariant
generalization
that
includes
the
NUT
charge.
