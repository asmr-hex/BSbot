\\
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
on
Maxwell
dynamics.
remarkably,
a
E_6
singularity
offers
the
possibility
of
bounding
(p,q)
branes
wrapped
on
a
Dih_n
orbifold
of
a
ALE
fibration
with
abelian
torsion.
using
the
behavior
of
the
Thirring
Model/QCD
correspondence,
we
survey
a
compactification
of
conformal
blocks
in
bosonic
strings
.
this
yields
an
extremely
precise
test
of
Virosoro
symmetry
breaking.
our
results
verify
that
Feynman

on

are
microscopic.
therefore,
boundary-duality
on
S^n

T^7
x
T^m
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
