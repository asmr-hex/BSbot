\\
we
survey
why
C_m
singularities
are
possible.
fortunately,
UV
behavior
is
multidimensional.
interestingly,
some
specific
paradigms
are
usually
obtained
by
the
partition
function
in
Heterotic
string
theory
on
\Z
quotients
of
\Z^m
bundles
over
H_6(S^n,\R)
quotients
of
Hom(\Z,\Q)
quotients
of
Riemann
surfaces.
we
discover
that
a
hyperplane
defect
is
present
as
hinted
at
by
Planck.
we
find
that
an
instanton
must
be
present
as
hinted
at
by
Nekrosov.
when
evaluating
Kobayashi
RS1,
we
predict
that,
as
realized
in
WIMPs,
holomorphic
instantons
are
microscopic.
