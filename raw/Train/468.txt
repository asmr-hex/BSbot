Target
Space
Dualities
of
Heterotic
Grand
Unified
Theories
\\
In
this
article
we
summarize
and
extend
the
ideas
and
investigations
on
so
called
target
space
dualities
of
heterotic
models
with
(0,2)
worldsheet
supersymmetry
as
they
were
partly
presented
on
the
String-Math
2011
conference.
After
the
generic
description
of
the
duality,
we
give
some
novel
examples
involving
vector
bundles
that
are
not
deformations
of
the
tangent
bundle
but
more
generic
ones
corresponding
to
SO(10)
and
SU(5)
gauge
theories
in
four
dimensions.
We
show
explicitly
that
the
necessary
conditions
for
a
duality
also
hold
for
compactifications
of
this
kind.
Finally
we
will
present
the
results
of
the
large
landscape
scan
of
E_6
models.
