Beta-ensembles
for
toric
orbifold
partition
function
\\
We
investigate
combinatorics
of
the
instanton
partition
function
for
the
generic
four
dimensional
toric
orbifolds.
It
is
shown
that
the
orbifold
projection
can
be
implemented
by
taking
the
inhomogeneous
root
of
unity
limit
of
the
q-deformed
partition
function.
The
asymptotics
of
the
combinatorial
partition
function
yields
the
multi-matrix
model
for
a
generic
$\beta$.
