On
Type
IIA
geometries
dual

N
=
2
SCFTs
\\
We
provide
explicit
solutions
of
Type
IIA
supergravity
which
are
believed
to
be
dual
to
N
=
2
superconformal
four
dimensional
gauge
theories.
These
explicit
solutions
are
based
on
the
general
ansatz
for
such
a
type
of
backgrounds
introduced
by
Gaiotto
and
Maldacena.
