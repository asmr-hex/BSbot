Fermions

\\
We
investigate
the
quantization
of
pure
U(1)
and
U(2)
gauge
theories
in
the
vicinity
of
non-trivial
ground
state
in
four-dimensional
Euclidean
space-time.
The
main
goal
is
to
make
the
simultaneous
consideration
of
many
vacuums
possible.
It
is
shown
that
Fueter
(quaternion)
analytic
and
anti
analytic
functions
can
be
used
as
vacuum's
collective
coordinates.
As
a
result
the
ground
state
describes
not
a
single
quasi
particle,
or
finite
number
of
such
particles,
but
a
field.
This
field
satisfies
the
massless
Dirac
equation.
This
is
not
a
contradiction
because
it
is
known
that
massless
spinors
can
be
quantized
either
as
fermions
or
as
bosons.
We
choose
to
quantize
the
vacuum
anomalously
(Fermi--Dirac).
The
anomalous
quantization
of
the
gauge
fields
ground
state
allows
non-trivial
(anti)
self-dual
configurations
to
exist.
The
possible
connection
to
the
lepton
sector
of
the
Standard
Model
is
discussed.
