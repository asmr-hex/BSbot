Cluster
Transformations
from
Bipartite
Field
Theories
\\
Bipartite
field
theories
(BFTs)
are
a
new
class
of
4d
N=1
quantum
field
theories
defined
by
bipartite
graphs
on
bordered
Riemann
surfaces.
In
this
paper
we
derive,
purely
in
terms
of
the
gauge
theory,
the
cluster
transformations
of
face
weights
under
square
moves
in
the
graph.
In
this
context,
we
obtain
them
by
connecting
regular
parametrizations
of
the
master
space
of
the
associated
BFTs.
For
BFTs
on
a
disk,
these
transformations
follow
from
the
properties
of
coordinates
in
the
Grassmannian.
This
represents
a
new
addition
to
the
list
of
combinatorial
objects
for
the
Grassmannian,
such
as
matching
and
matroid
polytopes,
that
have
been
shown
to
emerge
from
BFT
dynamics.
