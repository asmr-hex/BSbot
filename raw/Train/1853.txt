Tensionless
Strings
and
Galilean
Conformal
Algebra
\\
We
find
an
intriguing
link
between
the
symmetries
of
the
tensionless
limit
of
closed
string
theory
and
the
2-dimensional
Galilean
Conformal
Algebra
(2d
GCA).
2d
GCA
has
been
discussed
in
the
context
of
the
non-relativistic
limit
of
AdS/CFT
and
more
recently
in
flat-space
holography
as
the
proposed
symmetry
algebra
of
the
field
theory
dual
to
3d
Minkowski
spacetimes.
It
is
best
understood
as
a
contraction
of
two
copies
of
the
Virasoro
algebra.
In
this
note,
we
link
this
to
the
tensionless
limit
of
bosonic
closed
string
theory.
We
show
how
it
emerges
naturally
as
a
contraction
of
the
residual
gauge
symmetries
of
the
tensile
string
in
the
conformal
gauge.
We
also
discuss
a
possible
"dual"
interpretation
in
terms
of
a
point-particle
like
limit.
