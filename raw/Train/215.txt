Refined
topological
amplitudes
in
N=1
flux
compactification
\\
We
study
the
implication
of
refined
topological
string
amplitudes
in
the
supersymmetric
N=1
flux
compactification.
They
generate
higher
derivative
couplings
among
the
vector
multiplets
and
graviphoton
with
generically
non-holomorphic
moduli
dependence.
For
a
particular
term,
we
can
compute
them
by
assuming
the
geometric
engineering.
We
claim
that
the
Dijkgraaf-Vafa
large
N
matrix
model
with
the
beta-ensemble
measure
directly
computes
the
higher
derivative
corrections
to
the
supersymmetric
effective
action
of
the
supersymmetric
N=1$
gauge
theory.
