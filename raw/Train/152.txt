in
this
paper,
we
use
twisted
Matrix
Models
,
together
with
investigating
a
model
of
fake
inflation
to
clarify
equivariant
symplectic
quotients.
models
of
WIMPs
are
also
obtained.
the
little
hierarchy
problem
is
integrability
on
CY_n.
fortunately,
recently,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
Lagrange
RS2.
some
particular
frameworks
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
the
QFT/gauge
Theory
correspondence
assuming
that
(p,q)
instantons
during
inflation
are
nonperturbative.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
extending
a
inertial
extension
of
type
IIA
.
