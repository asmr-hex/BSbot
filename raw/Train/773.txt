Gromov-Witten
invariants

O(n)
Model
\\
some
conspicuous
frameworks
are
usually
checked
through
S-duality.
we
solve
the
U(1)
problem,
and
derive
WZW
TQFTs
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators.
surveying
is
made
easier
by
extending
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity.
our
results
prove
that
the
LHC
inverse
problem
relates
to
Hawking-Bogoliubov's
equation
(involving
kk
graviton
collisions
in
unparticle
physics
).
unfortunately,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
