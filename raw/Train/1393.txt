It
was
previously
found
that
in
a
certain
parameter
subspace
of
scalar-tensor
theories
emerging
from
massive
gravity,
the
only
stable
field
configuration
created
by
static
spherically
symmetric
sources
was
one
with
cosmological
asymptotics.
Moreover,
these
backgrounds
were
shown
to
be
sub-luminal
everywhere
in
the
space;
in
contrast
to
the
common
believe
that
these
theories
are
necessarily
superluminal
in
the
vicinity
of
a
static
source.
In
this
work
we
complete
that
analysis
by
extending
it
to
cover
the
whole
parameter
space
of
these
scalar-tensor
theories.
We
find
that
the
stability
argument
renders
the
asymptotically
flat
backgrounds
unrealizable,
forcing
once
again
for
cosmological
asymptotics.
In
the
case
of
pressureless
sources
these
backgrounds
are
stable.
However,
they
get
destabilized
in
the
presence
of
positive
pressure,
larger
than
a
critical
density.
Even
on
the
self-accelerated
background,
on
which
the
scalar
mode
decouples
from
sources,
in
the
region
occupied
by
the
source
it
acquires
an
elliptic
equation
of
motion.
Therefore,
we
conclude
that
the
only
parameter
space
which
is
not
ruled
out,
by
solar
system
measurements,
is
the
one
considered
in
