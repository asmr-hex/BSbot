substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
mathematicians
reviewing
F-Theory
.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
establish
that
topological
CFTs
on
fuzzy
rational
surfaces
are
calculable,
in
the
approximation
that
hyperkahler
quotients
in
extremal
CFTs

are
Poincare
symmetric.
however,
in
recent
years,
work
on
gauge
mediation
has
opened
up
a
inertial
class
of
bulk
models.
we
calculate
evidence
for
dions,
as
revealed
by
integration
cycles.
M-Theory
compactified
on
Ricci-flat
m-folds
is
also
considered.
when
constructing
a
U-dual
of
models
of
inflation,
we
derive
that,
in
the
limit
that
Schwinger
singularities
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
are
useful
for
generalizing
a
Seiberg-dual
of
Witten
isocurvature
dynamics,
a
magnetic-dual
of
twisted
TQFTs
supported
on
R^6
can
be
incorporated
into
a
lattice

continuation
of
the
transverse
Weinberg-Gubser
Model,
as
realized
in
exploring
