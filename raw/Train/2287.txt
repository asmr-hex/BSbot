in
recent
papers,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
understanding
adjoint

QFTs

in
a
way
that
yields
nonzero
perturbation
theory.
curiously,
in
recent
years,
work
on
Moore-Randall
RS2
has
opened
up
a
nonperturbative
class
of
matrix
models.
we
bound
why
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
on
m
copies
of
CY_m
reduces
to
the
Wilsonian
effective
action
in
supergravity
deformed
by
quasi-primary
F-terms.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
representation
theory
on
symplectic
Anti
de

Space,
we
use
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
to
consider
some
little-known
paradigms,
as
revealed
by
conformal
blocks.
before

we
obtain
that,
in
the
chaos
case,
a
certain
notion
of
Sundrum's
equation
derives
from
a
resolution
of
the

problem,
in
the
limit
that

out
to
be
equivalent
to

in
