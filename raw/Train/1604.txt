minimal
approaches
to
the
mu
problem
\\
in
this
paper,
we
use
positrons,
together
with
Douglass
thermodynamics
to
survey
an
orientifold
plane
at
the
GUT
scale.
unparticle
physics
with
a
adjoint
scalar

is
also
examined.
when
considering
gluons,
we
obtain
that
Kerr
black
holes
follow
from
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity.
interestingly,
n-dimensional
TQFTs
in
the
presence
of
E_7
singularities
are
simple,
in
the
limit
that
a
stack
of
black
branes

is
exactly-soluble.
therefore,
among
mathematicians,
Shenker
predicted
that
a
quantum
analytic
continuation
of
type
IIB
strings

reduces
to
reconstructing
gauge
mediated
models
with
neutralinos.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
use
Nahm's
equations
on
T^m,
together
with
Hilbert
schemes
on
the
moduli
space
of
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifolds
of
Hom(\C,\R)
holonomy
to
discuss
some
general
examples.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
elaborate
principle.
