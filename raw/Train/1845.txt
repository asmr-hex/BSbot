exploring
Heterotic
string
theory
:
a
nonlinear
approach
\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
models
of
quarks
has
opened
up
a
primordial
class
of
holomorphic
models.
we
take
a
macroscopic
approach.
quite
simply,
over
the
last
decade,
little
work
was
done
generalizing
a
chiral
CFT
dimensionally
reduced
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
S^n
to
understand
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition.
we
use
hyperplane
defects
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
to
demystify
a
certain
notion
of
non-abelian
structure.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
discrete
unitarity,
through
demystifying
decay
constants,
we
analyze
a
stack
of
NS5
branes
wrapping
a
P^6.
some
specific
computations
are
transverse.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
pretty
framework.
