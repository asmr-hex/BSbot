derives
from
the
little
hierarchy
problem.
surprisingly,
in
recent
years,
little
work
was
done
on
unconventional
models
.
we
take
a
supersymmetric
approach.
we
therefore
fail
to
confirm
a
result
of
Moore
that
conformal
models
for
cosmic
rays
are
diffeomorphism

Topological

reconstructed.
after
examining

we
calculate
that

P^n
is
momentum-dependent.

there
is
much
to
be
done.
