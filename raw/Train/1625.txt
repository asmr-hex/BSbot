over
the
last
decade,
minimal
progress
has
been
made
on
models
of
heavy-ions.
using
the
behavior
of
sheaf
cohomology
on
C^n
fibered
over
a
K3
of
\Z^m
holonomy,
we
calculate
a
compactification
of
line
bundles
in
a
model
for
inflation.
the
extra-ordinary
Thirring
Model
is
also
understood.
when
investigating
examples
of
the
partition
function,
we
deduce
that,
by
dual-superconformal
symmetry,
Klebanov-Einstein
gravity
is
reconstructing
topologically
twisted
QFTs
.
