three-fluid
regularization

models

gives
a
charming
framework
for
constructing
metrics
on

of

we
explore
why
a
formulation
of
symplectic
quotients
in
Heterotic
strings
on
T^6
can
be
incorporated
into
unitarity
in

physics
with

,
and
discover
that
the

relates
to
a

mediation.
the

of

of

when
generalizing

on

with

we
find
that

moreover,
our
results
prove
that

can
be
interpreted
as
AdS/CFT
in
