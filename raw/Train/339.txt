Review
of
the
N-quantum
Approach
to
Bound
States
\\
We
describe
a
method
of
solving
quantum
field
theories
using
operator
techniques
based
on
the
expansion
of
interacting
fields
in
terms
of
asymptotic
fields.
For
bound
states,
we
introduce
an
asymptotic
field
for
each
(stable)
bound
state.
We
choose
the
nonrelativistic
hydrogen
atom
as
an
example
to
illustrate
the
method.
Future
work
will
apply
this
N-quantum
approach
to
relativistic
theories
that
include
bound
states
in
motion.
