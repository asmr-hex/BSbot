\\
the

correspondence
(taking
into
account
Witten's
equation
in
String
theories
supported
on
del-Pezzos)
is
usually
deduced
by
a
m-dimensional
CFT
on
line
bundles
over
dS_m.

problem.
we

approach.

extending
integrability
in
nonperturbative
CFTs
deformed
by
quasi-primary
F-terms
(taking
into
account
geometric
transitions
in
a
model
of
inflation),
we
conjecture
that
Toda
CFTs
on
a

over
P^1
are
mass
inflationary.
finally,
we
solve
the
strong
CP
problem.
