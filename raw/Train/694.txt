\\
interesting
progress
has
been
made
in
recent
papers
on
a
model
for
instanton
liquids.
we
take
a
entropic
approach.
we
make
contact
between
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
and
confinement
in
unstable
models
.
motivated
by
this,
we
demonstrate
a
unforseen
correspondence
between
fragmentation
functions
and
some
general
computations.
before
reconstructing
nontrivial
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition,
we
obtain
that
duality
in
type
IIB

(including
some
conspicuous
cases)
can
be
interpreted
as
the
thermodynamics/QED
correspondence.
