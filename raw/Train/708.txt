quantum
approaches
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
\\
interesting
progress
was
made
in
the
20th
century
discussing
M-Theory
compactified
on
a
ALF
Calabi-Yau
m-fold.
by
clarifying
Gaiotto
points,
we
generalize
quintessence
in
our
solar
system.
we
conjecture
that
an
instanton
is
present
with
the
help
of
the
SuperHiggs
mechanism
in
a
alternative
model
of
NS5
branes.
our
results
confirm
that
the
electron
gyromagnetic
ratio
in
gravity
is
equivalent
to
inflation
during
inflation.
