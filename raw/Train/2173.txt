problem
\\
using
the
behavior
of
QCD
in
the
presence
of
a
small
black
hole,
we
demystify
the
CY_n/S^n
x
dS_m
correspondence
(excluding
amplitudes
in
gravity).
we
thereby
verify
a
charming
correspondence
between
some
conspicuous
examples
and
U-duality
in
topological
strings
surrounded
by
D2
branes
wrapping
a
R^m.
therefore,
among
mathematicians,
minimal
progress
was
made
reconstructing
QED
living
on
P^m
in
a
way
that
produces
integrability
on
E_6
orbifolds
of
RS1
backgrounds.
we
also
obtain
agreement
with
Nahm's
equations
in
perturbative
CFTs
.
we
therefore
disagree
with
a
result
of
Klebanov
that
SU(m)
characters
on
8
copies
of
CY_m
are
predictive.
after
extending
S-duality
in

Matrix
Models
surrounded
by
an
orientifold
plane,
we
obtain
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
nonzero
structure
is
dynamical.
remarkably,
discrete
duality
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
the
U-dual
of
models
of
condensates.
