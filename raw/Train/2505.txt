\\
We
study
the
field/antifield
formulation
of
pure
Yang
Mills
theory
in
the
framework
of
finite
field
dependent
BRST
transformation.
We
show
that
the
generating
functionals
corresponding
to
different
solutions
of
quantum
master
equation
are
connected
through
the
finite
field
dependent
BRST
transformations.
We
establish
this
result
with
the
help
of
several
explicit
examples.
