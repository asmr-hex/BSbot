\\
among
mathematicians,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
unparticle
physics.
we
take
a
inflationary
approach.
thus,
recently,
much
work
was
done
on
models
of
bubbles.
we
take
a
anthropic
approach.
we
make
contact
with
non-abelian
gerbs,
therefore
generalizing
bubbles
at
the
Planck
scale.
in
this

type

by

black
holes
makes
a
pretty
appearance.
a
non-minimal
resolution
of
the
naturalness
problem
is
inconsistent,
in
the
nonzero

case.
