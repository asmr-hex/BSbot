in
recent
years,
work
on
QCD
has
opened
up
a
supergravity
mediated
class
of
gravitational
models.
using
the
behavior
of
Seiberg-duality
in
the
high-scale
A-model,
we
reconstruct
partition
functions,
unambiguously
exploring
that
classifying
Landau-Ginzburg
models
with
axions
is
nilpotent.
therefore,
Donaldson
polynomials
in
Toda
Topological
Field
Theorys

are
nonperturbative.
before
obtaining
topological
strings
far
from
a
E_7
singularity,
we
check
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
non-abelian
perturbation
theory,
Georgi-Euler
conditions
on
R^4
are
useful
for
studying
line
defects.
