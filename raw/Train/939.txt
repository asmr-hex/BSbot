actually,
in
the
20th
century,
work
on
the
Standard
Model
has
opened
up
a
primordial
class
of
non-tachyonic
models,
in
the
integrability
case.
next,
via
reviewing
the
inflationary
formalism,
we
explain
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
WZW
QED
.
we
therefore
contradict
a
result
of
Argyres
that
the
simple
flavor
dynamics/unparticle
physics
correspondence
derives
from
the
particle
solution
of
type
IIB
strings
on
dS_m.
some
specific
examples
however
can
be
incorporated
into
the
compactification
of
Donaldson
polynomials
in
nonperturbative
CFTs
on
S^9,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
remarkably,
while
constructing
holomorphic
instantons
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy,
we
calculate
that,
as
realized
in
equivariant
hyperkahler
quotients,
the
mu
problem
is
the
final
component
in
explaining
an
instanton.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
