A
D2-brane
in
the
Penrose
limits
of
AdS(4)x
CP(3)
\\
We
consider
a
D2-brane
in
the
pp-wave
backgrounds
obtained
from
AdS$_4\times$CP$^3$
when
electric
and
magnetic
fields
have
been
turned
on.
Upon
fixing
the
light-cone
gauge,
light-cone
Hamiltonian
and
BPS
configurations
are
obtained.
In
particular
we
study
BPS
configurations
with
electric
dipole
on
the
two
sphere
giant
and
a
giant
graviton
rotating
in
transverse
directions.
Moreover
we
show
that
the
gauge
field
living
on
the
D2-brane
is
replaced
by
a
scalar
field
in
the
light-cone
Hamiltonian.
We
also
present
a
matrix
model
by
regularizing
(quantizing)
2-brane
theory.
