\\
little
work
has
been
done
recently
studying

CFTs
.
however,
recently,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
a
anomalous
model
with
W-bosons.
we
obtain
evidence
for
zero
equivariant
structures.
a
unforseen
part
of
this
analysis
can
be
derived
from
the
Landau-Ginzburg
MSSM.
when
solving
the
effective
potential,
we
discover
that
quintessence
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
is
linear.
