Quantum
Theory
of
ÄŒerenkov
Radiation,
Spectral
Cutoff
and
Resonances
\\
We
show
that
the
well-established
\v{C}erenkov
Effect
contains
new
phenomena
arising
directly
from
the
quantum
nature
of
the
charged
particles.
These
include
large
deviations
from
the
classically-expected
radiation
intensity
and
angle.
Most
importantly,
we
find
that
the
traditional
Cerenkov
angle
splits,
confining
the
emitted
radiation
into
two
distinctive
cones
into
which
two
photonic
shock
waves
are
emitted.
Interestingly,
one
of
the
two
shockwaves
can
move
on
a
backward
cone,
which
is
otherwise
considered
impossible
for
\v{C}erenkov
Radiaiton
in
ordinary
materials.
Moreover,
for
specific
values
of
the
particle
momentum,
we
predict
an
upper
frequency
cutoff
in
the
photon
emission.
Surprisingly,
for
this
extremum
frequency
we
find
a
diverging
rate
of
photon
emission,
implying
this
is
a
new
resonant
light-matter
interaction.
Some
of
these
new
effects
cannot
be
found
without
the
full
quantum
derivation.
Importantly,
our
findings
are
observable
for
electron
beams
with
realistic
parameters,
offering
new
applications
including
coherent
x-ray
sources
and
open
a
new
realm
for
\v{C}erenkov
detectors.
