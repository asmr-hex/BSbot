foam
\\
we
use
NS5
instantons,
together
with
the
U-dual
of
type
I
strings
deformed
by
nonlocal
operators
to
study
a
special
lagrangian
instanton.
topological
supergravity
surrounded
by
line
defects
is
also
derived.
our
results
demonstrate
that
considering
gravity
is
investigating
models
of
spacetime
foam.
unfortunately,
recently,
Nekrosov
realized
that
the
modified
analytic
continuation
of
bosonic
strings

is
calculable.
motivated
by
this,
we
use
orientifold
black
holes,
together
with
a
inflationary
solution
of
WZW
QCD
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
to
demystify
conformal
blocks
in
twisted
QED
in
the
presence
of
hyperplane
defects.
M-Theory
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines
is
also
classified.
unfortunately,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
