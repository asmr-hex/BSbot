Hyperbolic
deformation
of
the
strip-equation
and
the
accessory
parameters
for
the
torus
\\
By
applying
an
hyperbolic
deformation
to
the
uniformization
problem
for
the
infinite
strip,
we
give
a
method
for
computing
the
accessory
parameter
for
the
torus
with
one
source
as
an
expansion
in
the
modular
parameter
q.
At
O(q^0)
we
obtain
the
same
equation
for
the
accessory
parameter
and
the
same
value
of
the
semiclassical
action
as
the
one
obtained
from
the
b
-&gt;
0
limit
of
the
quantum
one
point
function.
The
procedure
can
be
carried
over
to
the
full
O(q^2)
or
even
higher
order
corrections
although
the
procedure
becomes
somewhat
complicated.
Here
we
compute
to
order
q^2
the
correction
to
the
weight
parameter
intervening
in
the
conformal
factor
and
it
is
shown
that
the
unwanted
contribution
O(q)
to
the
accessory
parameter
equation
cancel
exactly.
