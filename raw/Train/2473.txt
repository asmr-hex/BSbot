On
the
gauge
symmetries
of
the
spinning
particle
\\
We
reconsider
the
gauge
symmetries
of
the
spinning
particle
by
a
direct
examination
of
the
Lagrangian
using
a
systematic
procedure
based
on
the
Noether
identities.
It
proves
possible
to
find
a
set
of
local
Bosonic
and
Fermionic
gauge
transformations
that
have
a
simple
gauge
group
structure,
which
is
a
true
Lie
algebra,
both
for
the
massless
and
massive
case.
This
new
Fermionic
gauge
transformation
of
the
"position"
and
"spin"
variables
in
the
action
decouples
from
that
of
the
"einbein"
and
"gravitino".
