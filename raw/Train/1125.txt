Update
on
the
quantum
properties
of
the
Supermembrane
\\
In
this
note
we
summarize
some
of
the
quantum
properties
found
since
the
early
80's
until
nowdays
that
characterize
at
quantum
level
the
spectrum
of
the
supermembrane.
In
particular
we
will
focus
on
a
topological
sector
of
the
11D
supermembrane
that,
contrary
to
the
general
case,
has
a
purely
discrete
spectrum
at
supersymmetric
level.
This
construction
has
been
consistently
implemented
in
different
types
of
backgrounds:
toroidal
and
orbifold-type
with
G2
structure
able
to
lead
to
a
true
G2
compactification
manifold.
This
theory
has
N=1
supersymmetries
in
4D.
comment
on
the
relevant
points
of
this
construction
as
well
as
on
its
spectral
characteristics.
We
will
also
make
some
comments
on
the
quantum
properties
of
some
effective
formulation
of
multiple
M2's
theories
recently
found.
