Higgs
effect
in
consistent
Kaluza-Klein
models
with
branes
\\
We
continue
consideration
of
models
where
the
Higgs
effect
is
produced
by
the
presence
of
3-brane
fluctuating
in
compact
extra
dimensions.
The
consistent
examples
of
such
models
may
be
obtained
from
previously
known
solutions
of
6D
supergravity.
The
low-energy
limit
for
these
models
coincides
with
a
version
of
Higgs
model
written
in
terms
of
gauge-invariant
supercurrent
variables.
We
also
elaborate
on
vortices
in
the
Abelian
version
of
the
theory
and
show
how
vortices
that
are
singular
from
the
4D
point
of
view
become
allowed
due
to
higher-dimensional
resolution
of
singularity.
