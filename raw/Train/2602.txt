Qubits
from
extra
dimensions
\\
We
link
the
recently
discovered
black
hole-qubit
correspondence
to
the
structure
of
extra
dimensions.
In
particular
we
show
that
for
toroidal
compactifications
of
type
IIB
string
theory
simple
qubit
systems
arise
naturally
from
the
geometrical
data
of
the
tori
parametrized
by
the
moduli.
We
also
generalize
the
recently
suggested
idea
of
the
attractor
mechanism
as
a
distillation
procedure
of
GHZ-like
entangled
states
on
the
event
horizon,
to
moduli
stabilization
for
flux
attractors
in
F-theory
compactifications
on
elliptically
fibered
Calabi-Yau
four-folds.
Finally
using
a
simple
example
we
show
that
the
natural
arena
for
qubits
to
show
up
is
an
embedded
one
within
the
realm
of
fermionic
entanglement
of
quantum
systems
with
indistinguishable
constituents.
