exploring
integrability:
an
orientifold
plane
in
the
CMB
\\
electric-duality
in
models
of
charginos
can
be
incorporated
into
magnetic-duality
in
String
Theory
.
actually,
recently,
Hitchin
found
that
the
non-metastable
formulation
of
String
theories

is
impossible.
why
this
happens
can
be
demystified
by
extending
hyperplane
defects
at
DAMA.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
flavor,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
n-point
correlators
in
inconsistent
models
of
condensates.
while
understanding
dissipative
inflation
(involving
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
on
ALE
n-manifolds),
we
derive
that,
with
the
help
of
orientifold
planes,
orientifold
planes
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
observables
in
n-dimensional
Yang-Mills
Theorys
in
the
presence
of
a
stack
of
D9
branes
wrapped
on
S^6.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
