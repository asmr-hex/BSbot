in
the
20th
century,
partial
progress
has
been
made
classifying
String
Theory
on
Ricci-flat
superspace
in
order
to
avoid
deriving
a
certain
notion
of
zero
structure.
via
evaluating
Georgi-'t
Hooft
points,
we
explain
the
hierarchy
problem.
we
also
check
agreement
with
Heterotic
strings
on
a
non-compact
m-manifold.
after
extending
the
seesaw
mechanism
in
perturbative
Conformal
Field
Theorys
dimensionally
reduced
on
S^5
bundles
over
AdS_m,
we
derive
that
some
specific
frameworks
follow
from
loop
operators
on
n
copies
of
AdS_n.
finally,
we
establish
a
simple
correspondence
between
the
magnetic-dual
of
WZW
QFTs
on
P^m
and
hyperplane
defects.
