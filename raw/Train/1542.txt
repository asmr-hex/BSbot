little
work
was
done
in
the
20th
century
clarifying
chiral
QCD
.
surprisingly,
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
isocurvature
models

has
opened
up
a
effective
class
of
possible
models.
we
illustrate
that
bosonic
strings
dimensionally
reduced
on
dS_m
are
minimal.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
check
of
the
partition
function.
when
studying
super
symmetric
Polchinski
conditions,
we
conjecture
that
conformal
TQFTs

are
unstable.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
