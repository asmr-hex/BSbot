progress
in
models
of
quintessence
\\
little
work
has
been
done
in
recent
years
reviewing
topological
strings
.
we
solve
the
mu/B_mu
problem.
we
wholly
prove
a
simple
correspondence
between
the
possible
solution
to
the
naturalness
problem
through
observables
and
sheaf
cohomology.
when
obtaining
equivariant
vortex
equations,
we
conjecture
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
nontrivial
gerbs
follow
from
localization
in
a
twisted
Matrix
Model
deformed
by
primary
D-terms,
in
the
limit
that
localization
in
chiral
QFTs

is
momentum-dependent.
