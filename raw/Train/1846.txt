\\
Ryu
and
Takayanagi
conjectured
a
formula
for
the
entanglement
(von
Neumann)
entropy
of
an
arbitrary
spatial
region
in
an
arbitrary
holographic
field
theory.
The
von
Neumann
entropy
is
a
special
case
of
a
more
general
class
of
entropies
called
Renyi
entropies.
Using
Euclidean
gravity,
Fursaev
computed
the
entanglement
Renyi
entropies
(EREs)
of
an
arbitrary
spatial
region
in
an
arbitrary
holographic
field
theory,
and
thereby
derived
the
RT
formula.
We
point
out,
however,
that
his
EREs
are
incorrect,
since
his
putative
saddle
points
do
not
in
fact
solve
the
Einstein
equation.
We
remedy
this
situation
in
the
case
of
two-dimensional
CFTs,
considering
regions
consisting
of
one
or
two
intervals.
For
a
single
interval,
the
EREs
are
known
for
a
general
CFT;
we
reproduce
them
using
gravity.
For
two
intervals,
the
RT
formula
predicts
a
phase
transition
in
the
entanglement
entropy
as
a
function
of
their
separation,
and
that
the
mutual
information
between
the
intervals
vanishes
for
separations
larger
than
the
phase
transition
point.
By
computing
EREs
using
gravity
and
CFT
techniques,
we
find
evidence
supporting
both
predictions.
We
also
find
evidence
that
large-$N$
symmetric-product
theories
have
the
same
EREs
as
holographic
ones.
