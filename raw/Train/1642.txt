\\
We
explore
the
phase
structure
for
defect
theories
in
full
generality
using
the
gauge/gravity
correspondence.
On
the
gravity
side,
the
systems
are
constructed
by
introducing
M
(probe)
D(p+4-2k)-branes
in
a
background
generated
by
N
Dp-branes
to
obtain
a
codimension-k
intersection.
The
dual
gauge
theory
is
a
U(N)
Supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
theory
on
a
(1+p-k)-dimensional
defect
with
both
adjoint
and
fundamental
degrees
of
freedom.
We
focus
on
the
phase
structure
in
the
chemical
potential
versus
temperature
plane.
We
observe
the
existence
of
two
universality
classes
for
holographic
gauge
theories,
which
are
identified
by
the
order
of
the
phase
transition
in
the
interior
of
the
chemical
potential/temperature
plane.
Specifically,
all
the
sensible
systems
with
no
defect
show
a
third
order
phase
transition.
Gauge
theories
on
a
defect
with
(p-1)-spatial
directions
are
instead
characterised
by
a
second
order
phase
transition.
One
can
therefore
state
that
the
order
of
this
phase
transition
is
intimately
related
to
the
codimensionality
of
the
defect.
We
also
discuss
the
massless
hypermultiplet
at
low
temperature,
where
a
thermodynamical
instability
seems
to
appear
for
$p&lt;3$.
Finally,
we
comment
on
such
an
instability.
