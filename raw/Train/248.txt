Tachyon
potentials
from
a
supersymmetric
FRW
model
\\
Considering
that
the
effective
theory
of
closed
string
tachyons
can
have
worldsheet
supersymmetry,
as
shown
by
Vafa,
we
study
a
worldline
supersymmetric
action
in
a
FRW
background,
whose
superpotential
originates
a
tachyon
scalar
potential.
There
are
such
potentials
with
spontaneously
broken
supersymmetry
at
the
instability
and
supersymmetric
after
tachyon
condensation.
Furthermore,
given
a
tachyonic
potential,
the
superpotential
can
be
computed
by
a
power
series
ansatz
and
has
a
free
parameter
which
can
be
chosen
such
that
complex
solutions
become
real.
