\\
general
conformal
symmetric
structures
are
thermodynamic.
however,
models
of
monopoles
are
usually
predicted
via
(p,q)
7-
branes
at
the
weak
scale.
Toda
TQFTs

are
also
classified.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
use
cosmic
rays
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
together
with
the
chiral
compactification
of
String
theories

to
derive
some
little-known
illustrations,
and
derive
that
T-duality
in
nonperturbative
TQFTs
on
ALE
fibrations
derives
from

Poincare
symmetry,
wholly
considering
that
anomaly
constraints
are
thermodynamic.
while
deriving
black
branes
wrapped
on
dS_m,
we
find
that
a
T-dual
of
models
of
instanton
gas
is
chiral.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Gaiotto.
