Singular
Liouville
fields
and
spiky
strings
in
$\rr^{1,2}$
and
$SL(2,\rr)$
\\
The
closed
string
dynamics
in
$\rr^{1,2}$
and
$SL(2,\rr)$
is
studied
within
the
scheme
of
Pohlmeyer
reduction.
In
both
spaces
two
different
classes
of
string
surfaces
are
specified
by
the
structure
of
the
fundamental
quadratic
forms.
The
first
class
in
$\rr^{1,2}$
is
associated
with
the
standard
lightcone
gauge
strings
and
the
second
class
describes
spiky
strings
and
their
conformal
deformations
on
the
Virasoro
coadjoint
orbits.
These
orbits
correspond
to
singular
Liouville
fields
with
the
monodromy
matrixes
$\pm
I$.
The
first
class
in
$SL(2,\rr)$
is
parameterized
by
the
Liouville
fields
with
vanishing
chiral
energy
functional.
Similarly
to
$\rr^{1,2}$,
the
second
class
in
$SL(2,\rr)$
describes
spiky
strings,
related
to
the
vacuum
configurations
of
the
$SL(2,\rr)/U(1)$
coset
model.
