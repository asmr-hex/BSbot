Supersymmetric
BCS:
Effects
of
an
external
magnetic
field
and
spatial
fluctuations
of
the
gap
\\
Recently
an
N=1
supersymmetric
model
of
BCS
superconductivity
was
proposed
realizing
spontaneous
symmetry
breaking
of
a
U(1)_R
symmetry.
Due
to
scalar
contributions
the
superconducting
phase
transition
turned
out
to
be
first
order
rather
than
second
order
as
in
standard
BCS
theory.
Here
we
consider
the
effects
of
an
external
magnetic
field
and
spatial
fluctuations
of
the
gap
in
that
model.
This
allows
us
to
compute
the
magnetic
penetration
length
and
the
coherence
length,
and
also
to
distinguish
between
type
I
and
type
II
superconductors.
We
compare
the
supersymmetric
and
standard
relativistic
BCS
results,
where
the
main
differences
come
from
the
different
orders
of
the
phase
transition.
