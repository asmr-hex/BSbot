(involving
a

approach
to
the
LHC
inverse
problem).
actually,
in
recent
papers,
Cabibo
found
that
central
charges
on
the
moduli
space
of
symmetric
spaces
depend
on

at
ATLAS.
we
take
a
supersymmetric
approach.
we
thereby
prove
a
critical
correspondence
between
a
primordial
reduction
of
the
XXZ
Model
and
axion
production.
next,
we
use
Seiberg-duality
in
type
I
strings
,
together
with
the
effective
potential
to
reconstruct
D7
instantons
in
the
CMB.
while
understanding
some
particular
frameworks,
we
deduce
that
WIMPs
are
equivalent
to
type
I
strings
.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
