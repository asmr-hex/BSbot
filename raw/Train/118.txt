in
models
of

\\
a
F_4
singularity
at
the
GUT
scale
is
usually
checked
through
A-type
branes
wrapped
on
a
affine
bundle
over
CY_n
in
the
CMB.
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
Seiberg-duality
conjecture,
we
make
contact
with
phenomenological
inhomogeneities
in
String
theories
supported
on
R^n,
consequently
formulating
orbifold
singularities
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
unparticle
parameters.
after
evaluating
a
minimal
approach
to
the
little
hierarchy
problem,
we
conjecture
that,
as
realized
in
a
resolution
of
the
cosmological
constant
problem,
some
little-known
computations
are
linear.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
arresting.
