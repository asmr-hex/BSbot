equivariant
Donaldson

\\
superconformal
models
for
instanton
liquids
are
possible.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
bubbles,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
cosmic
rays
on
the
surface
of
the
sun.
inspired
by
this,
we
survey
why
general
divisors
follow
from
QED
with
a
dilation
symmetric
deformation
.
our
results
show
that
calculable
models
with
kk
gravitons
fortunately
can
be
derived
from
condensates
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.
