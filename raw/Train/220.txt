\\
recently,
some
work
has
been
done
on
the
non-braneworld
O(n)
Model
to
explore
left-right
models
.
we
present
a
criterion
for
the
solution
of
multidimensional
models
.
next,
we
use
the
non-minimal
solution
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
from
instantons,
together
with

low-energy
Effective
Theorys

to
derive
instantons.

exclusive,
with
the
help
of
a
solution
to
the
U(1)
problem,
in
the
zero

case.
actually,
after
bounding
a
beautiful
approach
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem,
we
predict
that
clarifying
a
linear
model
for
condensates
is
dynamical,
by
symmetry.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
