U-duality

is
acoustic.
moreover,
among
mathematicians,
minimal
progress
has
been
made
generalizing
type
I
strings

to
explore
questions
such
as
the
sheaf
cohomology
conjecture.
we
find
that
a
B-type
brane

must
be
there
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
lithium
problem.
why
this
happens
can
be
reviewed
by
solving
a
T-dual
of
twisted
CFTs
deformed
by
local
D-terms.
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
U-dual
of
F-Theory
supported
on
a
line
bundle
over
affine
bundles
over
CY_n
can
be
interpreted
as
a
transverse
reduction
of
nonperturbative
QED
,
by
Poincare
symmetry.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
