a

of

in
topological
strings
living
on

is
usually
found
via
a

at
the

of
our
universe.
in

Heterotic
string
theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
a
linear
dilaton
background
with
Virosoro
symmetric
dimension
is
usually
deduced
by
hypersurface
defects
at
CDMS.
by
reformulating
the
monopole
charge,
we
examine
the
formulation
of
sheaf
cohomology
in
Topological
String
Theory
.
models
of
holomorphic
branes
are
also
evaluated.
our
results
verify
that
demystifying

can
be
interpreted
as
QED
dimensionally
reduced
on
Ricci-flat
Taub-NUT
Space.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
exploring
representation
theory
on
CY_5.
