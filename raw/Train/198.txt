Creation
of
physical
modes
from
unphysical
fields
\\
We
present
a
basic
idea
and
a
toy
model
that
physical
modes
originate
from
unobservable
fields.
The
model
is
defined
on
a
higher-dimensional
space-time
and
has
fermionic
symmetries
that
make
fields
unphysical,
and
observable
modes
can
appear
through
a
dimensional
reduction.
