On
the
six-dimensional
origin
of
the
AGT
correspondence
\\
We
argue
that
the
six-dimensional
(2,0)
superconformal
theory
defined
on
M
\times
C,
with
M
being
a
four-manifold
and
C
a
Riemann
surface,
can
be
twisted
in
a
way
that
makes
it
topological
on
M
and
holomorphic
on
C.
Assuming
the
existence
of
such
a
twisted
theory,
we
show
that
its
chiral
algebra
contains
a
W-algebra
when
M
=
R^4,
possibly
in
the
presence
of
a
codimension-two
defect
operator
supported
on
R^2
\times
C
\subset
M
\times
C.
We
expect
this
structure
to
survive
the
\Omega-deformation.
