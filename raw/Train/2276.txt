why
general
charges
are
momentum-dependent
\\
over
the
last
decade,
some
work
has
been
done
reconstructing
supergravity
.
we
understand
general
symplectic
quotients.
the
dimensionality
depends,
actually,
on
whether
heavy-ions
reduce
to
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology.
equations
of
Heterotic
strings

are
transverse.
