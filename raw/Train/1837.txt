Defect
CFTs
and
holographic
multiverse
\\
We
investigate
some
aspects
of
a
recent
proposal
for
a
holographic
description
of
the
multiverse.
Specifically,
we
focus
on
the
implications
on
the
suggested
duality
of
the
fluctuations
of
a
bubble
separating
two
universes
with
different
cosmological
constants.
We
do
so
by
considering
a
similar
problem
in
a
2+1
CFT
with
a
codimension
one
defect,
obtained
by
an
M5-brane
probe
embedding
in
AdS_4x
S^7,
and
studying
its
spectrum
of
fluctuations.
Our
results
suggest
that
the
kind
of
behavior
required
by
the
spectrum
of
bubble
fluctuations
is
not
likely
to
take
place
in
defect
CFTs
with
an
AdS
dual,
although
it
might
be
possible
if
the
defect
supports
a
non-unitary
theory.
