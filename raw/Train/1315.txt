Decomposition
of
entanglement
entropy
in
lattice
gauge
theory
\\
We
consider
entanglement
entropy
between
regions
of
space
in
lattice
gauge
theory.
The
Hilbert
space
corresponding
to
a
region
of
space
includes
edge
states
that
transform
nontrivially
under
gauge
transformations.
By
decomposing
the
edge
states
in
irreducible
representations
of
the
gauge
group,
the
entropy
of
an
arbitrary
state
is
expressed
as
the
sum
of
three
positive
terms:
a
term
associated
with
the
classical
Shannon
entropy
of
the
distribution
of
boundary
representations,
a
term
that
appears
only
for
non-Abelian
gauge
theories
and
depends
on
the
dimension
of
the
boundary
representations,
and
a
term
representing
nonlocal
correlations.
The
first
two
terms
are
the
entropy
of
the
edge
states,
and
depend
only
on
observables
measurable
at
the
boundary.
These
results
are
applied
to
several
examples
of
lattice
gauge
theory
states,
including
the
ground
state
in
the
strong
coupling
expansion
of
Kogut
and
Susskind.
In
all
these
examples
we
find
that
the
entropy
of
the
edge
states
is
the
dominant
contribution
to
the
entanglement
entropy.
