The
Second
Sound
of
SU(2)
\\
Using
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence,
we
calculate
the
transport
coefficients
of
a
strongly
interacting
system
with
a
non-abelian
SU(2)
global
symmetry
near
a
second
order
phase
transition.
From
the
behavior
of
the
poles
in
the
Green's
functions
near
the
phase
transition,
we
determine
analytically
the
speed
of
second
sound,
the
conductivity,
and
diffusion
constants.
We
discuss
similarities
and
differences
between
this
and
other
systems
with
vector
order
parameters
such
as
p-wave
superconductors
and
liquid
helium-3.
