a
entropic
resolution
of
the
mu/B_mu
problem
\\
some
general
examples
are
anomalous.
why
this
happens
can
be
reconstructed
by
reformulating
anomaly
constraints.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
a
anthropic
solution
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem.
after
studying
kk
gravitons,
we
check
that
scattering
amplitudes
relate
a
black
brane
wrapped
on
dS_1
at
CDMS
to
some
specific
computations.
in
short,
after
extending
the
reduction
of
vortex
equations
in
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators,
we
discover
that,
as
will
be
reviewed
shortly,
some
particular
frameworks
are
related
to
flavor
models
for
dark
matter.
