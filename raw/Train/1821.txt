Doubling
of
the
Algebra
and
Neutrino
Mixing
within
Noncommutative
Spectral
Geometry
\\
We
study
physical
implications
of
the
doubling
of
the
algebra,
an
essential
element
in
the
construction
of
the
noncommutative
spectral
geometry
model,
proposed
by
Connes
and
his
collaborators
as
offering
a
geometric
explanation
for
the
standard
model
of
strong
and
electroweak
interactions.
Linking
the
algebra
doubling
to
the
deformed
Hopf
algebra,
we
build
Bogogliubov
transformations
and
show
the
emergence
of
neutrino
mixing.
