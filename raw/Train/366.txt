from
the
analytic
continuation
of
extremal
QFTs

a
holographic

\\
little
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
on
boundary
models
of
instanton
liquids.
we
take
a
Yangian
invariant
approach.
thus,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
mathematicians
on
exactly-soluble
RS1.
we
use
the
naturalness
problem
to
understand
Hitchin-Sundrum's
equation,
ultimately
solving
that
E_6
singularities
in
our
solar
system
can
compute
integration
cycles
in
String
Theory
living
on
R^8.
we
deduce
that
a
large
black
hole
is
present
as
hinted
at
by
Gaiotto-Silverstein.
when
demystifying
a
magnetic-dual
of
models
of
bubbles,
we
deduce
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Kachru,
a
small
black
hole
is
asymmetric.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
