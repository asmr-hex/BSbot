\\
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
recent
years
constructing
type
IIA
strings
.
we
present
a
criterion

Douglass's

fully
classifying
that
some
little-known
paradigms
can
be
predicted
from
condensates

we
derive
that
a
black
brane
wrapping
a
dS_5
exists
in
the
chaos
case.
our
results
illustrate
that
bubble
nucleation
during
inflation
reduces
to
a
certain
notion
of
gravitational-duality.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
key
edifice.
