Gauged
supergravities
in
5
and
6
dimensions
from
generalised
Scherk-Schwarz
reductions
\\
It
is
shown
that
the
Scherk-Schwarz
reduction
of
M-theory
in
the
Berman-Perry
duality
invariant
formalism
to
6
and
5
dimensions
reproduces
the
known
structures
of
gauged
supergravities
that
are
normally
associated
to
non-geometric
compactifications.
The
local
symmetries
defined
by
the
generalised
Lie
derivative
reduce
to
gauge
transformations
that
exactly
match
those
given
by
the
embedding
tensor
of
gauged
supergravity.
