Hawking
Radiation
from
Small
Black
Holes
at
Strong
Coupling
and
Large
N
\\
In
a
previous
work
an
approximate
static
metric
was
found
of
a
test
black
string
that
stretches
from
the
boundary
to
the
horizon
of
the
planar
Schwarzschild-AdS_5
geometry.
This
is
the
gravity
dual
of
the
Unruh
state
for
\mathcal{N}=4,
SU(N)
super
Yang-Mills
theory
on
a
4-dimensional
Schwarzschild
background,
at
large
N
and
large
'tHooft
coupling.
We
compute
the
holographic
stress
tensor
of
the
gravitational
solution
and
it
turns
out
to
possess
many
essential
features
of
the
Unruh
state
for
weakly-coupled
Hawking
radiation,
such
as
the
appearance
of
a
negative
energy
density
near
the
black
hole
horizon
and
a
positive
energy
density
at
infinity.
It
also
confirms
recent
results
that
at
leading
order
in
N,
the
expectation
value
of
the
stress
tensor
in
the
Unruh
state
is
finite
on
both
the
future
and
past
horizons,
and
that
at
this
order
there
are
no
flux
terms
as
is
expected
in
the
black
droplet
phase.
