T-duality
of
curvature
terms
in
D-brane
actions
\\
We
examine
the
known
curvature
terms
in
the
DBI
part
of
the
D-brane
action
under
the
T-duality
transformation.
Using
the
compatibility
of
the
action
with
the
standard
rules
of
T-duality
at
the
linear
order
as
a
guiding
principle,
we
include
the
appropriate
NS-NS
$B$-field
terms
in
the
action
and
show
that
they
reproduce
the
O(\alpha'^2)
terms
of
the
corresponding
disk-level
scattering
amplitude.
