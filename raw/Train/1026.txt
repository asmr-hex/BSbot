The
landscape
of
the
Hubbard
model
\\
I
present
a
pedagogical
survey
of
a
variety
of
quantum
phases
of
the
Hubbard
model.
The
honeycomb
lattice
model
has
a
conformal
field
theory
connecting
the
semi-metal
to
the
insulator
with
Neel
order.
States
with
fractionalized
excitations
are
linked
to
the
deconfined
phases
of
gauge
theories.
I
also
consider
the
confining
phases
of
such
gauge
theories,
and
show
how
Berry
phases
of
monopoles
induce
valence
bond
solid
order.
The
triangular
lattice
model
can
display
a
metal-insulator
transition
from
a
Fermi
liquid
to
a
deconfined
spin
liquid,
and
I
describe
the
theory
of
this
transition.
The
bilayer
triangular
lattice
is
used
to
illustrate
another
compressible
metallic
phase,
the
`fractionalized
Fermi
liquid'.
I
make
numerous
connections
of
these
phases
and
critical
points
to
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence.
In
particular,
I
argue
that
two
recent
holographic
constructions
connect
respectively
to
the
Fermi
liquid
and
fractionalized
Fermi
liquid
phases.
