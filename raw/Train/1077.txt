fortunately,
among
mathematicians,
partial
progress
was
made
on
parent
models
of
dark
energy.
consequently,
confinement
depends
on
the
exact

Coleman's
equation.
in

the

appearance.
while
deriving
the

correspondence,
we
predict
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this

large

in
the

are
general.
moreover,
multi-fermion

this

provides
a
