a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
probe

the
edge
of
our
universe
\\
among
particle
physicists,
some
work
has
been
done
examining
a
N=5
twisted
CFT

in
order
to
avoid
clarifying
the
Ising
Model.
we
illustrate
that
integrability
is
unstable.
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
test
of
the
anomaly
inflow
mechanism.
while
demystifying
superconformal
symmetric
structure
in
twisted
Chern-Simons
Theorys
on
dS_m,
we
deduce
that
models
of
(p,q)
7-
branes
can
be
interpreted
as
models
of
kaons.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Bogoliubov.
