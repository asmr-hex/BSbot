New
variables
for
the
Einstein
theory
of
gravitation
\\
The
set
of
10
covariant
vector
fields
is
taken
as
basic
variables
to
describe
the
gravitational
field.
Metric
$
g_{\mu\nu}
$
is
a
composite
field.
A
possibility
for
the
gravitational
constant
to
be
described
as
a
condensate
of
additional
scalar
field
is
discussed.
