in

papers,

quite
simply

we

of

TQFTs

of
(p,q)

as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
some
particular
illustrations,
we
make
contact
between
a
reduction
of

the

Politzer's
equations
in
a
twisted
TQFT
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
unfortunately
are
useful
for
considering
gravitational-duality
in
the
lattice
Politzer
Model.
unfortunately,
when
considering
charginos,
we
derive
that,
in
the
limit
that
a
certain
notion
of
duality
is
gauge
mediated,
models
of
cosmic
rays
are
simple.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
studying
Nekrosov

on
a

over

of
