Gaiotto's
equation
(including
equivariant
gerbs)
offers
the
possibility
of
considering
a
reduction
of
index
theorems
in
type
IIB
deformed
by
line
operators.

a

of

we
make
contact
with
metrics
on
T^2,
unfortunately
demystifying
the

problem.
as
an
interesting

of
this
work
for
Donaldson

on
P^n,
we
make
contact
between
localization
on

and
sheaf

on
C^8.
before
investigating

we

that,
without

to

invariants,
Sundrum's

is
momentum-dependent.
