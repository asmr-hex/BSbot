amplitudes
in
models
of

liquids
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
orientifold
planes
in
the
early
universe.
unfortunately,
in
recent
papers,
little
work
has
been
done
considering
M-Theory
deformed
by
local
F-terms
to
survey
recent
results
linking
some
conspicuous
examples
and
some
particular
frameworks.
in
this
result,
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
multi-field
models
for
quintessence
makes
a
pretty
appearance.
this
probably
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
m-point
correlators
in
multi-field
stochastic
inflation,
though
we've
been
unable
to
show
a
correspondence.
our
results
prove
that
hyperplane
defects
are
modified,
by
dual-superconformal
symmetry,
without
regard
to
bosonic
strings

our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Beckenstein.
