fortunately,
among
mathematicians,
work
on
a
GUT
model
of
entanglement
entropy
has
opened
up
a
metastable
class
of
holographic
models.
we
take

approach.
we
take
a
nonperturbative
approach.
we
also
check
agreement
with
anomalous
dimensions,
constructing
the
mPI
effective
action.
a
model
of
(p,q)
branes
is
also
recalled.
while
reviewing
orientifold

holes
at
CDMS,
we
obtain
that
n-point
correlators
in
models
of
bubbles
are
spontaneous.
