Fermi
arcs
from
holography
\\
In
this
paper,
we
find
mechanisms
for
the
generation
of
Fermi
arcs
using
the
gauge/gravity
correspondence.
The
gravity
background
is
taken
to
be
a
charged
black
hole
with
vector
hair
in
asymptotically
AdS4
spacetime.
The
response
function
of
fermion
probes
exhibits
a
p-wave
gap
in
the
dual
superconductor.
We
couple
the
fermions
to
a
charged
rank-two
antisymmetric
field.
Assuming
that
its
spatial
components
condense,
a
novel
type
of
open
Fermi
surface
is
produced.
We
derive
an
analytical
formula
for
the
Green's
function
and
study
its
unique
properties.
The
results
are
confirmed
by
separate
numerical
computations.
