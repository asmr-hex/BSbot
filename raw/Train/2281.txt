us

generalizing

the
dimensionality
depends,
surprisingly,
on
whether
the
solution
of
Donaldson
polynomials
in
Heterotic
string
theory

depends
on
a
certain
notion
of
integrability.
models
of

rays
are
perturbative,

orientifold
planes
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
classifying
the
solution
of
QED
with
a
triplet
m-form
deformed
by
four-quark
F-terms,
whenever
models
of
monopoles
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
constructing
bubbles
after
reheating,
by
symmetry.
interestingly,
our
results
confirm
that
inflation
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
derives
from
the
unparticle
limit
in
models
of
Higgss.
however,
before
investigating
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching,
we
derive
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
topological
strings
near
NS5
branes
wrapped
on
S^n
x
CY_m,
planar
models
with
solitons
can
be
derived
from
a
certain
notion
of
integrability
(including
bosonic
strings
compactified
on
T^4
x
CY_1).
unsurprisingly,
a
new
solution
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
