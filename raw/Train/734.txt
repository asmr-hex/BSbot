From
Scattering
Amplitudes
to
the
Dilatation
Generator
in
N=4
SYM
\\
The
complete
spin
chain
representation
of
the
planar
N=4
SYM
dilatation
generator
has
long
been
known
at
one
loop,
where
it
involves
leading
nearest-neighbor
2
-&gt;
2
interactions.
In
this
work
we
use
superconformal
symmetry
to
derive
the
unique
solution
for
the
leading
L
-&gt;
2
interactions
of
the
planar
dilatation
generator
for
arbitrarily
large
L.
We
then
propose
that
these
interactions
are
given
by
the
scattering
operator
that
has
N=4
SYM
tree-level
scattering
amplitudes
as
matrix
elements.
We
provide
compelling
evidence
for
this
proposal,
including
explicit
checks
for
L=2,3
and
a
proof
of
consistency
with
superconformal
symmetry.
