Heterotic

Building:
16
Special
Manifolds
\\
We
study
heterotic
model
building
on
16
specific
Calabi-Yau
manifolds
constructed
as
hypersurfaces
in
toric
four-folds.
These
16
manifolds
are
the
only
ones
among
the
more
than
half
a
billion
manifolds
in
the
Kreuzer-Skarke
list
with
a
non-trivial
first
fundamental
group.
We
classify
the
line
bundle
models
on
these
manifolds,
both
for
SU(5)
and
SO(10)
GUTs,
which
lead
to
consistent
supersymmetric
string
vacua
and
have
three
chiral
families.
A
total
of
about
29000
models
is
found,
most
of
them
corresponding
to
SO(10)
GUTs.
These
models
constitute
a
starting
point
for
detailed
heterotic
model
building
on
Calabi-Yau
manifolds
in
the
Kreuzer-Skarke
list.

data
for
these
models
