Higher
Spin
Gravity
and
Exact
Holography
\\
In
this
talk,
we
present
some
direct
evidences
of
the
Higher
Spin/Vector
Model
correspondence.
There
are
two
particular
examples
we
would
like
to
address
on.
The
first
example
concerns
a
constructive
approach
of
four
dimensional
higher
spin
theory
from
3d
O(N)
vector
model
based
on
a
bi-local
formulation.
These
bi-local
fields
are
seen
to
give
a
bulk
description
of
the
higher
spin
theory
with
extra
dimension
and
interactions.
The
second
example
is
a
similar
AdS_3/CFT_2
duality
put
forward
by
Gaberdiel
and
Gopakumar.
Specifically,
we
are
interested
in
black
hole
solutions
carrying
nonzero
higher
spin
charges.
The
partition
function
of
the
general
hs[\lambda]
higher
spin
black
hole
is
computed
from
the
CFT
side
using
the
W_\infty[\lambda]
symmetry
and
we
found
a
perfect
agreement
with
the
gravity
result.
