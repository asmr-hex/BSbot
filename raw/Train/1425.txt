The
gauging
of
BV
algebras
\\
A
BV
algebra
is
a
formal
framework
within
which
the
BV
quantization
algorithm
is
implemented.
In
addition
to
the
gauge
symmetry,
encoded
in
the
BV
master
equation,
the
master
action
often
exhibits
further
global
symmetries,
which
may
be
in
turn
gauged.
We
show
how
to
carry
this
out
in
a
BV
algebraic
set
up.
Depending
on
the
nature
of
the
global
symmetry,
the
gauging
involves
coupling
to
a
pure
ghost
system
with
a
varying
amount
of
ghostly
supersymmetry.
Coupling
to
an
N=0
ghost
system
yields
an
ordinary
gauge
theory
whose
observables
are
appropriately
classified
by
the
invariant
BV
cohomology.
Coupling
to
an
N=1
ghost
system
leads
to
a
topological
gauge
field
theory
whose
observables
are
classified
by
the
equivariant
BV
cohomology.
Coupling
to
higher
$N$
ghost
systems
yields
topological
gauge
field
theories
with
higher
topological
symmetry.
In
the
latter
case,
however,
problems
of
a
completely
new
kind
emerge,
which
call
for
a
revision
of
the
standard
BV
algebraic
framework.
