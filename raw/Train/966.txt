A
stringy
perspective
on
the
quantum
integrable
model/gauge
correspondence
\\
We
present
a
string
theory
realization
for
the
correspondence
between
quantum
integrable
models
and
supersymmetric
gauge
theories.
The
quantization
results
from
summing
the
effects
of
fundamental
strings
winding
around
a
compact
direction.
We
discuss
the
examples
of
the
XXZ
gauge/Bethe
correspondence
and
five-dimensional
\Omega--deformed
SYM
on
M
x
S^1.
