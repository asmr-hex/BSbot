a
extremal
QFT
deformed
by
nonlocal
F-terms
derives
from
the
QCD/R^m
correspondence.
unfortunately,
formulating
models
of
black
branes
is
usually
derived
via
WIMPs.
moreover,
the
R^n/technicolor
correspondence
is
simple.
a
perturbative
TQFT

is
also
reviewed.
before
analyzing
hydrodynamics,
we
find
that,
without
regard
to
equivariant
structure
on
R^m,
a
boundary-dual
of

TQFTs
supported
on
RS1
backgrounds
of
E_7
holonomy
is
predictive.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
