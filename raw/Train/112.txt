Hermitian-Yang-Mills
equations
and

bundles
on
nearly
Kaehler
and
nearly
Calabi-Yau
twistor
6-manifolds
\\
We
consider
the
Hermitian-Yang-Mills
(HYM)
equations
for
gauge
potentials
on
a
complex
vector
bundle
E
over
an
almost
complex
manifold
X^6
which
is
the
twistor
space
of
an
oriented
Riemannian
manifold
M^4.
Each
solution
of
the
HYM
equations
on
such
X^6
defines
a
pseudo-holomorphic
structure
on
the
bundle
E.
It
is
shown
that
the
pull-back
to
X^6
of
any
anti-self-dual
gauge
field
on
M^4
is
a
solution
of
the
HYM
equations
on
X^6.
This
correspondence
allows
us
to
introduce
new
twistor
actions
for
bosonic
and
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
theories.
As
examples
of
X^6
we
consider
homogeneous
nearly
Kaehler
and
nearly
Calabi-Yau
manifolds
which
are
twistor
spaces
of
S^4,
CP^2
and
B_4,
CB_2
(real
4-ball
and
complex
2-ball),
respectively.
Various
explicit
examples
of
solutions
to
the
HYM
equations
on
these
spaces
are
provided.
Applications
in
flux
compactifications
of
heterotic
strings
are
briefly
discussed.
