The
Cheshire
Cat
Principle
from
Holography
\\
The
Cheshire
cat
principle
states
that
hadronic
observables
at
low
energy
do
not
distinguish
between
hard
(quark)
or
soft
(meson)
constituents.
As
a
result,
the
delineation
between
hard/soft
(bag
radius)
is
like
the
Cheshire
cat
smile
in
Alice
in
wonderland.
This
principle
reemerges
from
current
holographic
descriptions
of
chiral
baryons
whereby
the
smile
appears
in
the
holographic
direction.
We
illustrate
this
point
for
the
baryonic
form
factor.
