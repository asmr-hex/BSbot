Isometry-preserving
boundary
conditions
in
the
Kerr/CFT
correspondence
\\
The
near-horizon
geometries
of
the
extremal
Kerr
black
hole
and
certain
generalizations
thereof
are
considered.
Their
isometry
groups
are
all
given
by
SL(2,R)
x
U(1).
The
usual
boundary
conditions
of
the
Kerr/CFT
correspondence
enhance
the
U(1)
isometry
to
a
Virasoro
algebra.
Various
alternatives
to
these
boundary
conditions
are
explored.
Partial
classifications
are
provided
of
the
boundary
conditions
enhancing
the
SL(2,R)
isometries
or
separately
the
U(1)
isometry
to
a
Virasoro
algebra.
In
the
case
of
SL(2,R)-enhancing
boundary
conditions
of
a
near-horizon
geometry
of
the
type
considered,
the
conserved
charges
associated
to
the
generators
of
the
asymptotic
Virasoro
symmetry
form
a
centreless
Virasoro
algebra.
