Exact
Solutions
for
Non-Hermitian
Dirac-Pauli
Equation
in
an
intensive
magnetic
field
\\
The
modified
Dirac-Pauli
equations,
which
are
introduced
by
means
of
${\gamma_5}$-mass
factorization
of
the
ordinary
Klein-Gordon
operator,
are
considered.
We
also
take
into
account
the
interaction
of
fermions
with
the
intensive
homogenous
magnetic
field
focusing
attention
to
their
(g-2)
gyromagnetic
factor.
The
basis
of
this
approach
is
developing
of
methods
for
study
of
the
structure
of
regions
of
unbroken
$\cal
PT$
symmetry
of
Non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians
which
be
no
studied
earlier.
For
that,
without
the
use
of
perturbation
theory
in
the
external
field
the
exact
energy
spectra
are
deduced
with
regard
to
spin
effects
of
fermions.
We
also
investigate
the
unique
possible
of
experimental
observability
the
non-Hermitian
restrictions
in
the
spectrum
of
mass
consistent
with
the
conjecture
Markov
about
Maximal
Mass.
This,
in
principal
will
may
allow
to
find
out
the
existence
of
an
upper
limit
value
in
spectrum
masses
of
elementary
particles
and
confirm
or
deny
the
significance
of
the
Planck
mass.
