and
hidden

in

\\
It
is
demonstrated
that
the
near-horizon
geometry
of
general
non-extremal
black
holes
can
be
described
by
a
portion
of
AdS
space.
We
show
that
the
reason
why
hidden
conformal
symmetries
near
horizons
of
general
non-extremal
black
holes
are
achieved
in
previous
works
is
that
the
near-horizon
geometries
have
been
equivalently
taken
as
these
AdS
segments
rather
than
simply
the
Rindler
space.
