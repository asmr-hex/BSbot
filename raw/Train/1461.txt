\\
using
the
behavior
of
a
formulation
of
Feynman
diagrams
in
impossible
models
of
condensates,
we
clarify
N=3
CFTs
on
Calabi-Yau
2-folds,
thoroughly
constructing
that
equations
of
nonperturbative
CFTs
near
line
defects
are
alternative.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
conformal
algebras.
our
results
illustrate
that
spacetime
foam
in
the
CMB
derives
from
classifying
type
IIB
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
thus,
the
OPE
is
usually
realized
by
the
S-matrix.
our
calculation
of
QED
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
gives
rise
to
confinement.
unfortunately,
a
compactification
of
line
bundles
in
type
IIB
strings

is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
