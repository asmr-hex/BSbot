Yang-Mills
instantons
on

cones
\\
We
study
the
construction
of
Hermitian
Yang-Mills
instantons
over
resolutions
of
Calabi-Yau
cones
of
arbitrary
dimension.
In
particular,
in
d
complex
dimensions,
we
present
an
infinite
family,
parametrised
by
an
integer
k
and
a
continuous
modulus,
of
SU(d)
instantons.
A
detailed
study
of
their
properties,
including
the
computation
of
the
instanton
numbers
is
provided.
We
also
explain
how
they
can
be
used
in
the
construction
of
heterotic
non-Kahler
compactifications.
