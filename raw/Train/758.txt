Deformed
Skyrme
Crystals
\\
The
Skyrme
crystal,
a
solution
of
the
Skyrme
model,
is
the
lowest
energy-per-charge
configuration
of
skyrmions
seen
so
far.
Our
numerical
investigations
show
that,
as
the
period
in
various
space
directions
is
changed,
one
obtains
various
other
configurations,
such
as
a
double
square
wall,
and
parallel
vortex-like
solutions.
We
also
show
that
there
is
a
sudden
"phase
transition"
between
a
Skyrme
crystal
and
the
charge
4
skyrmion
with
cubic
symmetry
as
the
period
is
gradually
increased
in
all
three
space
directions.
