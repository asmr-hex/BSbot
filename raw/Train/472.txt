effective

\\
We
present
a
method
for
calculating
solutions
and
corresponding
central
charges
for
backgrounds
with
AdS_3
and
S^k
factors
in
alpha'-exact
fashion
from
the
full
tree-level
low
energy
effective
action
of
heterotic
string
theory.
Three
examples
are
explicitly
presented:
AdS_3
X
S^3
X
T^4,
AdS_3
X
S^2
X
S^1
X
T^4
and
AdS_3
X
S^3
X
S^3
X
S^1.
Crucial
property
which
enabled
our
analysis
is
vanishing
of
the
Riemann
tensor
calculated
from
connection
with
"sigma-model
torsion".
We
show
the
following:
(i)
Chern-Simons
terms
are
the
only
source
of
alpha'-corrections
not
only
in
BPS,
but
also
in
non-BPS
cases,
suggesting
a
possible
extension
of
general
method
of
Kraus
and
Larsen,
(ii)
our
results
are
in
agreement
with
some
conjectures
on
the
form
of
the
part
of
tree-level
Lagrangian
not
connected
to
mixed
Cern-Simons
term
by
supersymmetry
(and
present
in
all
supersymmetric
string
theories),
(iii)
new
alpha'-exact
result
for
central
charges
in
AdS_3
X
S^3
X
S^3
X
S^1
geometry.
As
a
tool
we
used
our
generalization
of
Sen's
entropy
function
formalism
to
AdS_p
with
p&gt;2,
and
paid
special
attention
to
proper
definition
of
asymptotic
charges.
