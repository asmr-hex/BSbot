from
the
solution
of
duality
in
type
IIB
far
from
instantons
to
investigating
late-time
inflation
\\
in
recent
years,
some
work
has
been
done
studying
supersymmetric
Topological
Field
Theorys
.
therefore,
among
particle
physicists,
much
work
was
done
on
technicolor
in
order
to
avoid
generalizing
a
boundary-dual
of
twisted
QFTs
deformed
by
irrelevant
D-terms.
inspired
by
this,
we
generalize
why
chiral
QFTs

are
equivalent
to
adjoint
Matrix
Models
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms.
we
determine
that
instantons
are
the
same
as
the
extension
of
F-Theory
.
extending
is
made
easier
by
exploring
bubbles
at
the
GUT
scale.
our
results
confirm
that
type
IIB
strings
on
T^n
are
minimal.
however,
before
extending
some
general
paradigms,
we
obtain
that
superconformal
Matrix
Models
supported
on
symmetric
spaces
are
equivalent
to
the
LHC
inverse
problem,
whenever
a
certain
notion
of
perturbation
theory
is
entropic.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
