Localization
of
nonlocal
cosmological
models
with
quadratic
potentials
in
the
case
of
double
roots
\\
Nonlocal
cosmological
models
with
quadratic
potentials
are
considered.
We
study
the
action
with
an
arbitrary
analytic
function
F(\Box_g),
which
has
both
double
and
simple
roots.
The
formulae
for
nonlocal
energy-momentum
tensor,
which
correspond
to
double
roots,
have
been
obtained.
The
way
to
find
particular
solutions
for
nonlocal
Einstein
equations
in
the
case
when
F(\Box_g)
has
both
simple
and
double
roots
has
been
proposed.
One
and
the
same
functions
solve
the
initial
nonlocal
Einstein
equations
and
the
obtained
local
Einstein
equations.
