BRST
Lagrangian
construction
for
spin-3/2
field
in
Einstein
space
\\
We
explore
a
hidden
possibility
of
BRST
approach
to
higher
spin
field
theory
to
obtain
a
consistent
Lagrangian
for
massive
spin-3/2
field
in
Einstein
space.
Also,
we
prove
that
in
the
space
under
consideration
the
propagation
of
spin-3/2
field
is
hyperbolic
and
causal.
