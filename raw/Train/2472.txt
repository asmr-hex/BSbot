Critical
String
In
(3+1)+4
Dimensions
\\
We
assume
that
a
string
moves
in
an
eight
dimensional
space
that
can
be
divided
into
the
physical
four
dimensional
Minkowski
space
and
a
four
dimensional
Euclidean
internal
space
(we
call
it
so)
that
can
be
identified
with
gauge
symmetries
and
there
are
two
N=1
local
supersymmetries
on
the
world-sheet,
one
applicable
to
the
world-sheet
bosons
and
fermions
belonging
to
the
physical
space
as
in
the
NSR
model
and
the
other
to
those
belonging
to
the
internal
space
at
the
classical
level.
We
use
canonical
method
to
calculate
Virasoro
anomaly.
We
anti-normal
order
the
contributions
of
the
physical
fermions
(not
fermionic
ghosts)
to
the
Virasoro
algebra.
This
changes
sign
of
their
contributions
to
the
Virasoro
anomaly
and
shows
that
critical
strings
can
exist
in
four
dimensional
physical
Minkowski
space.
It
yields
a
spectrum
very
similar
to
the
$N=1,D=10$
theory,
but
with
some
differences.
The
ground
state
in
the
fermionic
sector
of
open
strings
is
a
Dirac
spinor
in
this
case.
The
Standard
Model
turns
out
the
most
natural
choice
of
gauge
symmetries,
if
the
number
of
generations
is
three.
