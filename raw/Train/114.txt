Periods
and
Hodge
structures
in
perturbative
quantum
field
theory
\\
There
is
a
fruitful
interplay
between
algebraic
geometry
on
the
one
side
and
perturbative
quantum
field
theory
on
the
other
side.
I
review
the
main
relevant
mathematical
concepts
of
periods,
Hodge
structures
and
Picard-Fuchs
equations
and
discuss
the
connection
with
Feynman
integrals.
