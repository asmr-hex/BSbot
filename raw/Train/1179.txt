Damped
Electromagnetic
fluctuations
in
the
early
universe?
\\
This
short
note
considers
the
effects
of
quantum
theory
on
the
linear
evolution
of
the
magnetic
fields
during
and
after
inflation.
The
analysis
appears
to
show
that
the
magnetic
fields
decay
exponentially
in
the
high-temperature
radiation
era
due
to
a
combination
of
ohmic
dissipation
and
vacuum
polarisation.
