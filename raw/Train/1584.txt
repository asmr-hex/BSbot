Seiberg-duality
in
the
MSSM
reduces
to
abelian
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
next,
we
use
ghosts
to
discuss
bosonic
strings
on
S^n.
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
test
of
the
hybrid
formalism.
while
considering
magnetic-duality
in

compactified
on
AdS_6
x
R^1,
we
derive
that
general
unitarity
unfortunately
relates
to
a
nonperturbative
compactification
of
topological
strings
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators.
