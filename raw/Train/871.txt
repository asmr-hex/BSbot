The
D^6
R^4
term
from
three
loop
maximal
supergravity
\\
We
consider
the
D^6
R^4
term
which
is
the
leading
contribution
in
the
low
momentum
expansion
of
the
three
loop,
four
graviton
amplitude
in
maximal
supergravity.
We
calculate
the
moduli
dependent
coefficient
of
this
term
in
11
dimensional
supergravity
compactified
on
T^2.
Only
diagrams
that
involve
the
Mercedes
skeleton
contribute
resulting
in
a
compact
expression
involving
an
integral
over
6
Schwinger
parameters.
We
express
this
integral
as
an
integral
over
the
moduli
of
an
auxiliary
T^3.
This
includes
an
SL(3,Z)
invariant
integral
over
the
shape
moduli
of
the
T^3.
We
discuss
the
renormalization
of
the
ultraviolet
divergences
of
this
amplitude
that
arise
from
the
boundaries
of
moduli
space.
The
renormalized
amplitude
is
simple
which
is
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
D^6
R^4
term
is
BPS.
