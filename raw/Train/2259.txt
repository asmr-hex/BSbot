Towards
Lagrangian
formulations
of
mixed-symmetry
Higher
Spin
Fields
on
AdS-space
within
BFV-BRST
formalism
\\
The
spectrum
of
superstring
theory
on
the
$AdS_5
\times
S_5$
Ramond-Ramond
background
in
tensionless
limit
contains
integer
and
half-integer
higher-spin
fields
subject
at
most
to
two-rows
Young
tableaux
$Y(s_1,s_2)$.
We
review
the
details
of
a
gauge-invariant
Lagrangian
description
of
such
massive
and
massless
higher-spin
fields
in
anti-de-Sitter
spaces
with
arbitrary
dimensions.
The
procedure
is
based
on
the
construction
of
Verma
modules,
its
oscillator
realizations
and
of
a
BFV-BRST
operator
for
non-linear
algebras
encoding
unitary
irreducible
representations
of
AdS
group.
