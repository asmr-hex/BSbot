Special
limits
and
non-relativistic
solutions
\\
We
study
special
vanishing
horizon
limit
of
`boosted'
black
D3-branes
having
a
compact
light-cone
direction.
The
type
IIB
solution
obtained
by
taking
such
a
zero
temperature
limit
is
found
to
describe
a
nonrelativistic
system
with
dynamical
exponent
3.
We
discuss
about
such
limits
in
M2-branes
case
also.
