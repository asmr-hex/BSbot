Anthropic
constraints
on
fermion
masses
\\
We
summarize
the
results
of
previous
research
on
the
constraints
imposed
on
quark
masses
by
the
anthropically-motivated
requirement
that
there
exist
stable
nuclei
with
the
right
charge
to
form
complex
molecules.
We
also
mention
an
upper
bound
on
the
mass
of
the
lightest
lepton,
derived
from
the
requirement
that
such
nuclei
be
stable
against
electron
capture.
