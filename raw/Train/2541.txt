Holographic
Superconductors
and
Higher
Curvature
Corrections
\\
We
study
a
fully
backreacted
holographic
model
of
a
four-dimensional
superconductor
by
including
a
higher
curvature
interaction
in
the
bulk
action.
We
study
how
the
critical
temperature
and
the
field
theory
condensate
vary
in
this
model
and
conclude
that
positive
higher
curvature
couplings
make
the
condensation
harder.
We
also
compute
the
conductivity,
finding
significant
deviations
from
the
conjectured
universal
frequency
gap
to
critical
temperature
ratio.
