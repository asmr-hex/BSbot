Holography
and
drag
force
in
thermal
plasma
of
non-commutative
Yang-Mills
theories
in
diverse
dimensions
\\
We
use
holography
and
a
string
probe
approach
to
compute
the
drag
force
on
a
quark
moving
in
a
thermal
plasma
of
non-commutative
Yang-Mills
(NCYM)
theories
in
various
dimensions.
The
gravity
background
in
these
cases
are
described
by
a
particular
decoupling
limit
of
non-extremal
(D$(p-2)$,
D$p$)
brane
bound
state
system.
We
show
how
the
drag
force
on
an
external
quark
moving
in
the
dual
NCYM
theories
gets
corrected
due
to
non-commutativity
and
as
a
result
the
effective
viscosity
of
the
plasma
gets
reduced.
We
have
obtained
the
drag
force
for
both
small
and
large
non-commutativity.
This
was
known
earlier
for
(3+1)-dimensional
NCYM
theory,
however,
we
find
that
the
corrections
for
the
general
case
typically
depend
on
the
dimensionality
of
the
NCYM
theories,
indicating
that
the
structure
of
the
drag
force
is
non-universal.
