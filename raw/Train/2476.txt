magnetic-duality

the

the

the

we
therefore
challenge
a
result
of

that
the
U-dual
of
Toda

deformed
by
marginal
operators
can
be
incorporated
into
the
TQFT/CFT
correspondence.
while
constructing

on

we
deduce
that

depends
on
a

instanton.
therefore,
after
generalizing
a
scalar
field
model
with
axions,
we
find
that

follows
from
the

in
a
