\\
Puff
Field
Theory
is
a
low
energy
decoupling
regime
of
string
theory
that
still
retains
the
non-local
attributes
of
the
parent
theory
-
while
preserving
isotropy
for
its
non-local
degrees
of
freedom.
It
realizes
an
extended
holographic
dictionary
at
strong
coupling
and
dynamical
non-local
states
akin
to
defects
or
the
surface
operators
of
local
gauge
theories.
In
this
work,
we
probe
the
non-local
features
of
PFT
using
D3
branes.
We
find
supersymmetric
configurations
that
end
on
defects
endowed
with
non-Abelian
degrees
of
freedom.
These
are
2+1
dimensional
defects
in
the
3+1
dimensional
PFT
that
may
be
viewed
as
volume
operators.
We
determine
their
R-charge,
vacuum
expectation
value,
energy,
and
gauge
group
structure.
