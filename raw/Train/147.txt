On
the
power
spectrum
of
inflationary
cosmologies
dual
to
a
deformed
CFT
\\
We
analyse
slow-roll
inflationary
cosmologies
that
are
holographically
dual
to
a
three-dimensional
conformal
field
theory
deformed
by
a
nearly
marginal
scalar
operator.
We
show
the
cosmological
power
spectrum
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
spectral
density
associated
with
the
2-point
function
of
the
trace
of
the
stress
tensor
in
the
deformed
CFT.
Computing
this
quantity
using
second-order
conformal
perturbation
theory,
we
obtain
a
holographic
power
spectrum
in
exact
agreement
with
the
expected
inflationary
power
spectrum
to
second
order
in
slow
roll.
