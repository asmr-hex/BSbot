the
quantum
gravitational
formalism
\\
in
recent
years,
little
work
was
done
on
cosmon
dynamics.
we
conjecture
evidence
for
the
CFT/Matrix
Model
correspondence,
and
derive
that
nonzero
structures
in
Heterotic
strings
living
on
a
\Z_4
orbifold
of
C^n
are
possible,
and
clarify
a
new
resolution
of
the
fine-tuning
problem.
why
this
happens
can
be
considered
by
explaining
sheaf
cohomology.
when
solving
the
solution
of
QED
with
symmetric
tensor
fermions
,
we
predict
that,
as
will
be
explored
shortly,
perturbation
theory
can
be
incorporated
into
quintessence
at
ATLAS.
