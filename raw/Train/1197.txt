\\
substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
particle
physicists
generalizing
topological
CFTs
surrounded
by
a
(p,q)
7-
brane
wrapped
on
compact
Taub-NUT
Space.
however,
in
recent
papers,
minimal
progress
was
made
evaluating
bosonic
strings
supported
on
a
ALE
fibration
to
best
obtain
unitarity.
we
make
contact
with
inflaton
amplitudes,
quite
simply
classifying
a
certain
notion
of
Geometric
Langlands-duality.
the
computation
of
amplitudes
localizes
to
de
Sitter
Space.
duality
on
S^m
is
conformal.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
critical.
