Elementary
Particles
as
Gates
for
Universal
Quantum
Computation
\\
It
is
shown
that
there
exists
a
mapping
between
the
fermions
of
the
Standard
Model
(SM)
represented
as
braids
in
the
Bilson-Thompson
model,
and
a
set
of
gates
which
can
perform
Universal
Quantum
Computation
(UQC).
This
leads
us
to
conjecture
that
the
"Computational
Universe
Hypothesis"
(CUH)
can
be
given
a
concrete
implementation
in
a
new
physical
framework
where
elementary
particles
and
the
gauge
bosons
(which
intermediate
interactions
between
fermions)
are
interpreted
as
the
components
of
a
quantum
computational
network,
with
the
particles
serving
as
quantum
computational
gates
and
the
gauge
fields
as
the
information
carrying
entities.
