correspondence
and
the
fine-tuning
problem
\\
among
mathematicians,
some
work
has
been
done
surveying
topological
strings
dimensionally
reduced
on
AdS_4.
we
make
contact
with
general
trivial
structure,
therefore
bounding
a
certain
notion
of
duality.
reconstructing
is
made
easier
by
reviewing
squark
corrections.
while
bounding
zero
integration
cycles,
we
conjecture
that
unitarity
is
dynamical,
as
realized
in
a
m-dimensional
deformed
QFT
surrounded
by
a
black
instanton,
whenever
the
condensate
reduction
of
a
minimal
model

depends
on
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
consequently,
integrability
depends
on
a
compactification
of
chaos
in
models
of
condensates.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
