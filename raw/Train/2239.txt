Gaugings
at
angles
from
orientifold
reductions
\\
We
consider
orientifold
reductions
to
N=4
gauged
supergravity
in
four
dimensions.
A
special
feature
of
this
theory
is
that
different
factors
of
the
gauge
group
can
have
relative
angles
with
respect
to
the
electro-magnetic
SL(2)
symmetry.
These
are
crucial
for
moduli
stabilisation
and
De
Sitter
vacua.
We
show
how
such
gaugings
at
angles
generically
arise
in
orientifold
reductions.
