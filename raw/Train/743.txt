Asymptotic
safety
and
the
cosmological
constant
\\
We
study
the
non-perturbative
renormalisation
of
quantum
gravity
in
four
dimensions.
Taking
care
to
disentangle
physical
degrees
of
freedom,
we
observe
the
topological
nature
of
conformal
fluctuations
arising
from
the
functional
measure.
The
resulting
beta
functions
possess
an
asymptotically
safe
fixed
point
with
a
global
phase
structure
leading
to
classical
general
relativity
for
positive,
negative
or
vanishing
cosmological
constant.
If
only
the
conformal
fluctuations
are
quantised
we
find
an
asymptotically
safe
fixed
point
predicting
a
vanishing
cosmological
constant
on
all
scales.
At
this
fixed
point
we
reproduce
the
critical
exponent,
$\nu
=
1/3$,
found
in
numerical
lattice
studies
by
Hamber.
This
suggests
the
fixed
point
may
be
physical
while
solving
the
cosmological
constant
problem.
