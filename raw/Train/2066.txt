The
generalised
KÃ¤hler
geometry
of
Wess-Zumino-Witten
models
\\
In
this
work
a
thorough
study
of
a
number
of
specific
supersymmetric
sigma-models
with
extended
supersymmetry
is
performed
within
the
context
of
generalised
complex
geometry.
More
specifically
the
supersymmetric
Wess-Zumino-Witten
model
on
a
variety
of
group
manifolds
was
considered.
By
explicitly
calculating
the
admissible
complex
structures
and
the
associated
pure
spinors
on
the
target
manifold
a
full
characterisation
of
the
different
possible
geometries
is
provided.
By
using
this
approach
the
various
aspects
of
generalised
K\"ahler
geometry
can
be
studied
in
detail.
Also
considered
are
the
various
isometries
present
in
the
model
and
duality
relations
linking
the
different
descriptions.
