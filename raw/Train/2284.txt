VSFT
revisited
\\
We
argue
validity
of
purely
ghost
kinetic
operator
in
open
string
field
theory
from
the
perspective
of
the
modern
analytic
method
based
on
the
$K
B
c$
subalgebra.
A
purely
ghost
kinetic
operator
is
obtained
as
a
result
of
gauge
fixing
string
field
theory
around
the
identity
based
tachyon
vacuum
solution.
It
is
shown
that
the
obtained
kinetic
operator
is
not
equivalent
to
the
midpoint
insertion
of
the
conformal
ghost
which
is
extensively
studied
in
literature.
We
also
find
that
the
equation
of
motion
does
not
allow
any
nontrivial
solutions.
