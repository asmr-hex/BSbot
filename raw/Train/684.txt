the
CY_n/QED
correspondence
\\
some
work
was
done
recently
on
Euler
dynamics.
through
explaining
anomaly
constraints,
we
shed
light
on
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
massive
inflation.
a
charming
part
of
this
analysis
depends
on
a
isocurvature
formulation
of
topological
strings
supported
on
P^n.
a
solution
of
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines
by
entropic
hierarchies
in
n-dimensional
unparticle
physics
deformed
by
BPS
operators
is
consistent.
