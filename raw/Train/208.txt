S-matrix
for
the
massive
and
massless
modes
of
the
AdS_2
x
S^2
superstring
\\
We
derive
the
exact
S-matrix
for
the
integrable
system
associated
to
light-cone
gauge
string
theory
on
AdS_2
x
S^2
x
T^6.
The
S-matrix
for
the
massive
modes
consists
of
two
copies
of
a
centrally-extended
su(1|1)
invariant
S-matrix
and
is
in
agreement
with
the
tree-level
result
following
from
perturbation
theory.
Although
the
overall
factor
is
left
unfixed,
the
constraints
following
from
crossing
symmetry
and
unitarity
are
given.
The
scattering
involves
long
representations
of
the
symmetry
algebra,
and
the
relevant
representation
theory
is
studied
in
detail.
We
also
discuss
Yangian
symmetry
and
find
it
has
a
standard
form
in
the
massless
case,
for
which
we
specify
all
S-matrices
explicitly.
Finally,
some
brief
comments
are
given
on
the
Bethe
ansatz.
