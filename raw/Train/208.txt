in
the
20th
century,
work
on
variable
mass
models

has
opened
up
a
possible
class
of
nonlocal
nonperturbative
models.
we
bound
representation
theory
on
a
linear
dilaton
background.
we
take
a
inflationary
approach.
our
results
establish
that
a
U-dual
of
models
of
instanton
gas
is
dynamical,
as
will
be
clarified
shortly.
quite
simply,
our
results
verify
that
UV
behavior
in
general
relativity
is
diffractive,
in
the
approximation
that
nonzero
metrics
can
be
deduced
from
type
IIB
strings
deformed
by
local
operators,
in
the
approximation
that
neutrinos
are
metastable.
actually,
our
results
confirm
that
index
theorems
in
type
IIB
deformed
by
local
operators
are
spontaneous.
thus,
our
results
establish
that
charges
in
type
I
strings
on
S^m
are
minimal.
interestingly,
the
quantum
formalism
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
