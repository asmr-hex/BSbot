Towards
effective
Lagrangians
for
adelic
strings
\\
p-Adic
strings
are
important
objects
of
string
theory,
as
well
as
of
p-adic
mathematical
physics
and
nonlocal
cosmology.
By
a
concept
of
adelic
string
one
can
unify
and
simultaneously
study
various
aspects
of
ordinary
and
p-adic
strings.
By
this
way,
one
can
consider
adelic
strings
as
a
very
useful
instrument
in
the
further
investigation
of
modern
string
theory.
It
is
remarkable
that
for
some
scalar
p-adic
strings
exist
effective
Lagrangians,
which
are
based
on
real
instead
of
p-adic
numbers
and
describe
not
only
four-point
scattering
amplitudes
but
also
all
higher
ones
at
the
tree
level.
In
this
work,
starting
from
p-adic
Lagrangians,
we
consider
some
approaches
to
construction
of
effective
field
Lagrangians
for
p-adic
sector
of
adelic
strings.
It
yields
Lagrangians
for
nonlinear
and
nonlocal
scalar
field
theory,
where
spacetime
nonlocality
is
determined
by
an
infinite
number
of
derivatives
contained
in
the
operator-valued
Riemann
zeta
function.
Owing
to
the
Riemann
zeta
function
in
the
dynamics
of
these
scalar
field
theories,
obtained
Lagrangians
are
also
interesting
in
themselves.
