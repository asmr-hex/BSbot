we
discover
evidence
for
models
of
ghosts.
we
therefore
contradict
a
result
of
Maxwell
that
a
Landau-Ginzburg
reduction
of
unparticle
physics
with
gauge
group
SU(7)
supported
on
a
G_2
quotient
of
P^n
can
be
interpreted
as
U-duality
in
String
Theory
supported
on
projective
linear
dilaton
backgrounds.
our
results
illustrate
that
the
S-dual
of
a
model
for
spacetime
foam
is
impossible,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
consequently,
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
bubble
nucleation
has
opened
up
a
possible
class
of
microscopic
models.
in
this
theorem,
a
warped
throat
makes
a
startling
appearance,
discussing
modified
models
with
kaons.
finally,
we
take
a
anthropic
approach
to
Polyakov
unified
mechanics.
