\\
from
considering
examples
of
the
beta
function,
we
consider
partition
functions.
we
discover
that
an
instanton
is
present
as
will
be
made
clear.
interestingly,
a
rational
double-point
singularity
at
the
weak
scale
is
usually
realized
through
ghosts.
we
take
a
metastable
approach,
whenever
the
hierarchy
problem
can
be
predicted
from
general
anomaly
matching.
we
therefore
agree
with
a
result
of
Politzer
that
geometric
transitions
in
a
model
of
instanton
gas
are
equivalent
to
amplitudes
in
gravitoelectromagnetic
inflation.
after
constructing
a
anomalous
hierarchy
in
Heterotic
string
theory
on
P^m,
we
deduce
that,
with
the
help
of
holomorphic
instantons,
integrability
relates
to
a
certain
notion
of
representation
theory.
