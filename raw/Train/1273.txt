Quantum
Field
Theory
in
de
Sitter
spacetime
\\
In
this
paper
we
will
analyse
quantum
field
theory
on
de
Sitter
spacetime.
We
will
analyse
a
general
scalar
and
vector
field
theory
on
de
Sitter
spacetime.
This
is
done
by
first
calculating
these
propagators
on
four-Sphere
and
then
analytically
continuing
it
to
de
Sitter
spacetime.
