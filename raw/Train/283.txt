Local
and
Global
Casimir
Energies:
Divergences,
Renormalization,
and
the
Coupling
to
Gravity
\\
From
the
beginning
of
the
subject,
calculations
of
quantum
vacuum
energies
or
Casimir
energies
have
been
plagued
with
two
types
of
divergences:
The
total
energy,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
some
sort
of
regularization
of
the
zero-point
energy,
$\sum\frac12\hbar\omega$,
seems
manifestly
divergent.
And
local
energy
densities,
obtained
from
the
vacuum
expectation
value
of
the
energy-momentum
tensor,
$\langle
T_{00}\rangle$,
typically
diverge
near
boundaries.
The
energy
of
interaction
between
distinct
rigid
bodies
of
whatever
type
is
finite,
corresponding
to
observable
forces
and
torques
between
the
bodies,
which
can
be
unambiguously
calculated.
The
self-energy
of
a
body
is
less
well-defined,
and
suffers
divergences
which
may
or
may
not
be
removable.
Some
examples
where
a
unique
total
self-stress
may
be
evaluated
include
the
perfectly
conducting
spherical
shell
first
considered
by
Boyer,
a
perfectly
conducting
cylindrical
shell,
and
dilute
dielectric
balls
and
cylinders.
In
these
cases
the
finite
part
is
unique,
yet
there
are
divergent
contributions
which
may
be
subsumed
in
some
sort
of
renormalization
of
physical
parameters.
The
divergences
that
occur
in
the
local
energy-momentum
tensor
near
surfaces
are
distinct
from
the
divergences
in
the
total
energy,
which
are
often
associated
with
energy
located
exactly
on
the
surfaces.
However,
the
local
energy-momentum
tensor
couples
to
gravity,
so
what
is
the
significance
of
infinite
quantities
here?
For
the
classic
situation
of
parallel
plates
there
are
indications
that
the
divergences
in
the
local
energy
density
are
consistent
with
divergences
in
Einstein's
equations;
correspondingly,
it
has
been
shown
that
divergences
in
the
total
Casimir
energy
serve
to
precisely
renormalize
the
masses
of
the
plates,
in
accordance
with
the
equivalence
principle.
