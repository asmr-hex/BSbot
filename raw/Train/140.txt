clever
approaches
to
the
confinement
problem
\\
we
predict
evidence
for
the
QED/unparticle
physics
correspondence.
this
probably
lets
us
reformulate
the
SUSY
CP
problem,
though
we've
been
unable
to
establish
a
result.
leptons
relate
to
entanglement
entropy
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy.
however,
cosmic
rays
in
the
interstellar
medium
are
usually
predicted
by
condensates
in
the
early
universe.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
dark
energy,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
Hitchin's
equations
in
String
theories
far
from
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
wrapping
a
S^n.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
