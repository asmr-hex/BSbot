holes
derive
from
the
CFT/anomaly
mediation
correspondence.
N=1
CFTs
deformed
by
marginal
D-terms
are
also
clarified.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
instanton
liquids
at
DAMA.
while
understanding
Randall
unparticle
physics,
we
calculate
that,
whenever
sheaf
cohomology
in
topological
unparticle
physics

can
be
incorporated
into
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology,
GUT
models
with
kk
gravitons
are
minimal.
