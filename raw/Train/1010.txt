String
Embeddings
of
the
Pentagon
\\
The
Pentagon
Model
is
an
explicit
supersymmetric
extension
of
the
Standard
Model,
which
involves
a
new
strongly-interacting
SU(5)
gauge
theory
at
TeV-scale
energies.
We
discuss
embeddings
of
the
Pentagon
Model
into
string
theory,
specifically
N=1
supersymmetric
type
IIa
intersecting
D-brane
models,
M-theory
compactifications
of
G_2
holonomy,
and
heterotic
orbifold
constructions.
