Quantum
field
theory
based
on
birefringent
modified
Maxwell
theory
\\
In
the
current
paper
the
properties
of
a
birefringent
Lorentz-violating
extension
of
quantum
electrodynamics
is
considered.
The
theory
results
from
coupling
modified
Maxwell
theory,
which
is
a
CPT-even
Lorentz-violating
extension
of
the
photon
sector,
to
a
Dirac
theory
of
standard
spin-1/2
particles.
It
is
then
restricted
to
a
special
birefringent
case
with
one
nonzero
Lorentz-violating
coefficient.
The
modified
dispersion
laws
of
electromagnetic
waves
are
obtained
plus
their
phase
and
group
velocities
are
considered.
After
deriving
the
photon
propagator
and
the
polarization
vectors
for
a
special
momentum
configuration
we
prove
both
unitarity
at
tree-level
and
microcausality
for
the
quantum
field
theory
based
on
this
Lorentz-violating
modification.
These
analytical
proofs
are
done
for
a
spatial
momentum
with
two
vanishing
components
and
the
proof
of
unitarity
is
supported
by
numerical
investigations
in
case
all
components
are
nonvanishing.
The
upshot
is
that
the
theory
is
well-behaved
within
the
framework
of
our
assumptions
where
there
is
a
possible
issue
for
negative
Lorentz-violating
coefficients.
The
paper
shall
provide
a
basis
for
the
future
analysis
of
alternative
birefringent
quantum
field
theories.
