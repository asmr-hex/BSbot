On
the
Bogomol'nyi
bound
in
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
gravity
\\
It
has
been
shown
that
the
4-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
theory
allows
a
Bogomol'nyi-type
inequality
for
an
arbitrary
dilaton
coupling
constant
$\alpha
$,
and
that
the
bound
is
saturated
if
and
only
if
the
(asymptotically
flat)
spacetime
admits
a
nontrivial
spinor
satisfying
the
gravitino
and
the
dilatino
Killing
spinor
equations.
The
present
paper
revisits
this
issue
and
argues
that
the
dilatino
equation
fails
to
ensure
the
dilaton
field
equation
unless
the
solution
is
purely
electric/magnetic,
or
the
dilaton
coupling
constant
is
given
by
$\alpha=0,
\sqrt
3$,
corresponding
to
the
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell
theory
and
the
Kaluza-Klein
reduction
of
5-dimensional
vacuum
gravity,
respectively.
A
systematic
classification
of
the
supersymmetric
solutions
reveals
that
the
solution
can
be
rotating
if
and
only
if
the
solution
is
dyonic
or
the
coupling
constant
is
given
by
$\alpha=0,
\sqrt
3$.
This
implies
that
the
theory
with
$\alpha
\ne
0,
\sqrt
3$
cannot
be
embedded
into
supergravity
except
for
the
static
truncation.
Physical
properties
of
supersymmetric
solutions
are
explored
from
various
points
of
view.
