We
compute
the
ratio
of
the
coefficient
of
shear
viscosity
to
entropy
density
at
finite
coupling
and
at
zero
chemical
potential
using
holographic
duality
up
to
ten
derivative
terms
in
the
low
energy
effective
5-dimensional
action,
of
a
specific
kind,
which
may
or
may
not
be
connected
to
the
supersymmetric
completion
of
Type
IIB
theory.
The
result
suggests
that
this
ratio
can
be
positive
only
for
the
8th
derivative
term
even
with
the
form
of
that
term
in
the
action
as
${{\cal
C}^{ij}}_{kl}{{\cal
C}^{kl}}_{mn}{{\cal
C}^{mn}}_{rs}{{\cal
C}^{rs}}_{ij}$,
where
${\cal
C}$
is
the
Weyl
tensor.
