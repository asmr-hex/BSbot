N=4
chiral

\\
We
couple
N=4
chiral
supermultiplet
with
an
auxiliary
N=4
fermionic
supermutiplet
containing
on-shell
four
physical
fermions
and
four
auxiliary
bosons.
The
latter
ones
play
the
role
of
isospin
variables.
We
choose
the
very
specific
coupling
which
results
in
a
component
action
containing
only
time
derivatives
of
fermionic
components
presented
in
the
auxiliary
supermultiplet,
which
therefore
may
be
dualized
into
auxiliary
ones.
The
resulting
component
action
describes
the
interaction
of
the
chiral
supermultiplet
with
a
magnetic
field
constant
on
the
pseudo-sphere
$SU(1,1)/U(1)$.
Then
we
specify
the
prepotential
of
our
theory
to
get,
in
the
bosonic
sector,
the
action
for
the
particle
moving
over
the
pseudo-sphere
--
Lobachevsky
space.
We
provided
also
the
Hamiltonian
formulation
of
this
system
and
show
that
the
full
symmetry
group
of
our
system
is
$SU(1,1)\times
U(1)$.
The
currents
forming
the
$su(1,1)$
algebra
are
modified,
as
compared
to
the
bosonic
case,
by
the
fermionic
and
isospin
terms,
while
the
additional
u(1)
current
contains
only
isospin
variables.
