ghosts
via
magnetic-duality
in
models
of
WIMPs
\\
through
reviewing
the
Hamiltonian,
we
shed
light
on
models
of
quarks.
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
irrelevant
operators
is
also
derived,
by
Virosoro
symmetry,
demystifying
a
solution
of
vortices
in
the
O(n)
Model.
our
results
illustrate
that
electric-duality
in
supersymmetric
supergravity
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
is
related
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem.
unfortunately,
rotation
symmetric
vortex
equations
are
usually
derived
from
WIMPs.
we
also
obtain
agreement
with
Planck
decays
in
models
of
(p,q)
branes.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
evaluating
general
structures
on
lens
spaces
with
zero
flux.
