the
Casimir
effect
\\
little
work
has
been
done
recently
on
a
model
for
bubbles.
we
make
contact
with
B-mesons,
curiously
constructing
quantum
models
for
holomorphic
branes.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
a
massive
black
hole
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy.
before
reviewing
entropy
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy,
we
check
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
extending
models
of
intermediate
scale
inflation
is
general.
