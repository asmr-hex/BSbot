The
Jackiw-Pi
model
and
its
symmetries
\\
The
non-Abelian
gauge
model
proposed
by
Jackiw
and
Pi,
which
generates
an
even-parity
mass
term
in
three
space-time
dimensions,
is
revisited
in
this
letter.
All
the
symmetries
of
the
model
are
collected
and
established
by
means
of
BRS
invariance
and
Slavnov-Taylor
identity.
The
path
for
the
perturbatively
quantization
of
the
Jackiw-Pi
model,
through
the
algebraic
method
of
renormalization,
is
presented.
