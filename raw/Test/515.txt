CP(N-1)
model
on
finite
interval
in
the
large
N
limit
\\
The
CP(N-1)
\sigma\
model
on
finite
interval
of
length
R
with
Dirichlet
boundary
conditions
is
analysed
in
the
1/N
expansion.
The
theory
has
two
phases,
separated
by
a
phase
transition
at
R
~
1/\Lambda,
\Lambda\
is
dynamical
scale
of
the
CP(N-1)
model.
The
vacuum
energy
dependence
of
R,
and
especially
Casimir-type
scaling
1/R,
is
discussed.
