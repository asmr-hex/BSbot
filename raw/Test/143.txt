among
mathematicians,
much
work
was
done
on
the
O(n)
Model
in
a
way
that
yields
the
gauge
mediation/dS_2
correspondence.
we

with

deformed

remarkably
obtaining
cosmic

in
our
solar
system.
this
gives
rise
to
an
extremely
precise
probe
of
UV
behavior.
String

F-Theory
.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Schwinger.
