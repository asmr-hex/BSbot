Deformations
with
Maximal
Supersymmetries
Part
2:
Off-shell
Formulation
\\
Continuing
our
exploration
of
maximally
supersymmetric
gauge
theories
(MSYM)
deformed
by
higher
dimensional
operators,
in
this
paper
we
consider
an
off-shell
approach
based
on
pure
spinor
superspace
and
focus
on
constructing
supersymmetric
deformations
beyond
the
first
order.
In
particular,
we
give
a
construction
of
the
Batalin-Vilkovisky
action
of
an
all-order
non-Abelian
Born-Infeld
deformation
of
MSYM
in
the
non-minimal
pure
spinor
formalism.
We
also
discuss
subtleties
in
the
integration
over
the
pure
spinor
superspace
and
the
relevance
of
Berkovits-Nekrasov
regularization.
