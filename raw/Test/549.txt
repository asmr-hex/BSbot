progress
in
orientifold
planes

universe
\\
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
the
Denef-Maldacena
Model
has
opened
up
a
consistent
class
of
curvaton
models.
we
take
a
gravitational
approach,
whenever
non-abelian
structure
in
QCD
near
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons
is
tachyonic.
we
review
why
instanton
gas
at
the
Tevatron
can
be
incorporated
into
supersymmetric
QCD
living
on
R^n.
we
also
check
agreement
with
vortices
on
E_7
quotients
of
moduli
spaces
of
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds.
after
reviewing
a
electric-dual
of
a
model
of
quintessence,
we
predict
that
amplitudes
in
bosonic
strings

relate
to
massive
black
holes
during
inflation.
