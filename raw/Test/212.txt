Laplace-Beltrami
operator
and
exact
solutions
for
branes
\\
Proposed
is
a
new
approach
to
finding
exact
solutions
of
nonlinear
$p$-brane
equations
in
$D$-dimensional
Minkowski
space
based
on
the
use
of
various
initial
value
constraints.
It
is
shown
that
the
constraints
$\Delta^{(p)}\vec{x}=0$
and
$\Delta^{(p)}\vec{x}=-\Lambda(t,\sigma^r)\vec{x}$
give
two
sets
of
exact
solutions.
