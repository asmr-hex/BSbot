a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
is
equivalent
to
representation
theory
in

supergravity
deformed
by
multi-fermion
operators.
F-Theory

is
also
understood.
in
this
correspondence,
bounding
nonperturbative
QFTs
supported
on

makes
a

of

we
check
that
the
formulation
of

in

of
condensates
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
exploring
