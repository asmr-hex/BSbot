Relativistic
diffusion
in
random
gluon
fields
\\
We
consider
Wong
equations
for
a
particle
with
a
continuous
mass
spectrum
in
a
random
Yang-Mills
field
approximating
the
quantum
field
at
finite
temperature.
We
show
that
particle
time
evolution
can
be
approximated
by
a
relativistic
diffusion.
Kubo's
generator
of
the
relativistic
diffusion
is
defined
as
an
expectation
value
of
the
square
of
the
Liouville
operator.
