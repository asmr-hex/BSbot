why
charges
on
R^n
are
effective
\\
orientifold
planes
are
linear.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
next,
we
use
the
CFT/Matrix
Model
correspondence,
together
with
U-duality
in
Toda
Soft-Collinear
Effective
Theorys

to
calculate
ADE
singularities
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
our
results
verify
that
vortices
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
hyper-Kahler
exotic
ALE
fibration
are
nilpotent.
