Cosmology
on
Compact
and
Stable
Supergravity
Background
\\
We
propose
a
cosmological
model
of
D3-brane
universe
on
compact
and
stable
supergravity
background
of
wrapped
D7-branes
in
type
IIB
string
theory
previously
argued
to
be
dual
to
pure
N=1
SU(N)
gauge
theory
in
four
dimensions.
A
model
universe
of
order
Planck
size
near
the
UV
boundary
dynamically
flows
toward
the
IR
with
constant
total
energy
density
and
accelerating
expansion
followed
by
smooth
transition
to
decelerating
expansion
and
collides
with
the
wrapped
D7-branes
at
the
IR
boundary.
The
model
addresses
the
horizon
and
flatness
problems
with
most
of
the
expansion
produced
during
the
decelerating
expansion
phase.
The
inflationary
scenario
is
used
to
generate
sources
of
inhomogeneities
in
the
cosmic
microwave
background
radiation
and
seeds
for
large
scale
structure
formation
from
quantum
fluctuations
which
exit
the
Hubble
radius
early
during
the
accelerating
expansion
phase
and
the
model
addresses
the
inhomogeneity
problem
with
red
tilt
in
the
power
spectrum.
We
propose
that
the
kinetic
energy
of
the
model
universe
is
converted
to
matter
and
radiation
by
the
collision
followed
by
formation
of
baryons
that
stabilizes
the
model
universe
against
gravitational
force
from
the
background
at
a
finite
distance
from
the
IR
boundary
with
the
wrapped
D7-branes
serving
as
sources
of
color.
Friedmann
evolution
then
takes
over
with
a
positive
cosmological
constant
term
coming
from
the
remaining
potential
energy
density
which
is
interpreted
as
dark
energy.
The
magnitude
of
dark
energy
density
is
smaller
than
the
total
energy
density
during
the
flow
by
a
ratio
of
the
scale
factor
when
the
model
universe
appears
in
the
UV
to
the
scale
factor
at
the
moment
of
collision
and
stays
constant
while
the
matter-radiation
density
falls
during
Friedmann
expansion.
