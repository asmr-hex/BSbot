Renormalization
of
the
2PI
Hartree-Fock
approximation
on
de
Sitter
background
in
the
broken
phase
\\
The
infrared
effects
for
light
minimally
coupled
scalar
fields
with
quartic
self-interaction
in
de
Sitter
space
is
investigated
using
the
2PI
effective
action
formalism.
This
formalism
partially
resums
infinite
series
of
loop
diagrams,
and
enables
us
to
circumvent
the
IR
divergence
problem
for
a
massless
minimally
coupled
scalar
field
in
de
Sitter
space.
It
is
anticipated
that
nonperturbative
infrared
effects
generate
a
curvature-induced
mass
and
self-regulate
the
IR
divergence.
However,
due
to
its
nonperturbative
nature,
the
renormalization
prescription
is
a
nontrivial
task.
To
calculate
physical
quantities,
an
appropriate
renormalization
prescription
is
required.
In
this
paper,
we
will
show
that
the
MS-like
scheme
is
possible
at
the
Hartree-Fock
truncation
of
the
2PI
effective
action,
and
infinite
series
of
divergent
terms
are
needed
as
counterterms.
The
phase
structure
and
the
quantum
backreaction
to
Einstein's
field
equation
are
calculated.
