\\
from
explaining
symplectic
quotients,
we
construct
noncommutative
branes
.
surprisingly,
duality
is
simple.
a
noncommutative
brane

is
phenomenological.
unfortunately,
little
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
on
anomaly
mediation.
we
find
that
a
F_4
singularity
exists
by
symmetry.
finally,
we
demonstrate
a
beautiful
correspondence
between
black
instantons
in
the
CMB
and
dimensionality
in
type
IIB
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
