Higher
Spin
Black
Holes
from
CFT
\\
Higher
spin
gravity
in
three
dimensions
has
explicit
black
holes
solutions,
carrying
higher
spin
charge.
We
compute
the
free
energy
of
a
charged
black
hole
from
the
holographic
dual,
a
2d
CFT
with
extended
conformal
symmetry,
and
find
exact
agreement
with
the
bulk
thermodynamics.
In
the
CFT,
higher
spin
corrections
to
the
free
energy
can
be
calculated
at
high
temperature
from
correlation
functions
of
W-algebra
currents.
