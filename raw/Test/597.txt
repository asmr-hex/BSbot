Extra
dimensions,
black
holes
and
fireballs
at
the
LHC
\\
The
collision
of
two
gravitationally
interacting,
ultra-relativistic,
extended
sources
is
being
examined.
This
investigation
classifies
the
transverse
distributions
that
are
collided
for
fixed
collision
energy,
according
to
whether
one
or
two
(a
small
and
a
large)
apparent
horizons
may
or
may
not
be
formed
in
a
flat
background
in
4
dimensions.
The
study
extends
to
the
thermodynamical
properties
of
the
objects
that
are
created,
which
exhibit
a
universal
behavior
in
their
entropy,
and,
suggests
the
elimination
of
the
possibility
in
observing
black
holes
(BHs)
at
the
LHC
in
the
absence
of
extra
dimensions.
On
the
other
hand,
including
extra
dimensions,
and
assuming
that
the
matter
is
localized
(dense)
enough
in
those
directions,
opens
new
avenues
in
creating
BHs
at
energies
of
the
order
of
TeV.
The
investigation
is
carried
further
to
$AdS_5$
backgrounds
and
makes
connections
with
the
implications
for
the
quark-gluon
plasma
(QGP)
formation
in
heavy
ion
collisions.
In
particular,
classes
of
the
geometries
found
suggest
that
a
BH
is
formed
if
and
only
if
the
(central
collision)
energy
is
sufficiently
large
compared
to
the
transverse
scale
of
the
corresponding
gauge
theory
side
stress-tensor.
This
implies
that
when
the
scattering
in
the
gravity
description
is
mapped
onto
a
heavy
ion
collision
problem
yields
a
result,
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
current
intuition
and
data:
QGP
is
formed
only
at
high
enough
energies
compared
to
$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
even
for
central
processes.
Incorporating
weak
coupling
physics
and
in
particular
the
Color
Glass
Condensate
(CGC)
model,
a
satisfactory
fitting
with
the
RHIC
and
the
LHC
data
for
multiplicities
may
be
established.
