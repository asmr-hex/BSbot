\\
In
the
present
paper
we
continue
the
project
of
systematic
construction
of
invariant
differential
operators
for
non-compact
semisimple
Lie
groups.
Our
starting
points
is
the
class
of
algebras,
which
we
call
'conformal
Lie
algebras'
(CLA),
which
have
very
similar
properties
to
the
conformal
algebras
of
Minkowski
space-time,
though
our
aim
is
to
go
beyond
this
class
in
a
natural
way.
For
this
we
introduce
the
new
notion
of
{\it
parabolic
relation}
between
two
non-compact
semisimple
Lie
algebras
g
and
g'
that
have
the
same
complexification
and
possess
maximal
parabolic
subalgebras
with
the
same
complexification.
Thus,
we
consider
the
exceptional
algebra
E_{7(7)}
which
is
parabolically
related
to
the
CLA
E_{7(-25)},
the
parabolic
subalgebras
including
E_{6(6)}
and
E_{6(-6)}
.
Other
interesting
examples
are
the
orthogonal
algebras
so(p,q)
all
of
which
are
parabolically
related
to
the
conformal
algebra
so(n,2)
with
p+q=n+2,
the
parabolic
subalgebras
including
the
Lorentz
subalgebra
so(n-1,1)
and
its
analogs
so(p-1,q-1).
We
consider
also
E_{6(6)}
and
E_{6(2)}
which
are
parabolically
related
to
the
hermitian
symmetric
case
E_{6(-14)},
the
parabolic
subalgebras
including
real
forms
of
sl(6).
We
also
give
a
formula
for
the
number
of
representations
in
the
main
multiplets
valid
for
CLAs
and
all
algebras
that
are
parabolically
related
to
them.
In
all
considered
cases
we
give
the
main
multiplets
of
indecomposable
elementary
representations
including
the
necessary
data
for
all
relevant
invariant
differential
operators.
In
the
case
of
so(p,q)
we
give
also
the
reduced
multiplets.
We
should
stress
that
the
multiplets
are
given
in
the
most
economic
way
in
pairs
of
{\it
shadow
fields}.
Furthermore
we
should
stress
that
the
classification
of
all
invariant
differential
operators
includes
as
special
cases
all
possible
{\it
conservation
laws}
and
{\it
conserved
currents},
unitary
or
not.
