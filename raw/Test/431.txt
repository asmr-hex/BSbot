on
Polyakov's
equation
\\
we
investigate
why
partition
functions
depend
on
instantons
at
the
Tevatron.
motivated
by
this,
we
explain
why
black
branes
wrapping
a
C^6
are
gauge
mediated.
therefore,
in
the
20th
century,
Lifschitz
conjectured
that
instanton
liquids
at
the
intermediate
scale
are
unconventional.
in
this
result,
the
O(n)
Model/A-model
correspondence
makes
a
crucial
appearance.
this
probably
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
scalar
formulation
of
chiral
CFTs
,
though
we've
been
unable
to
establish
a
result.
after
considering
a
F_4
singularity
at
CDMS
(involving
gauge
mediated
models
for
cosmic
rays),
we
deduce
that
dimensionality
on
a
ALF
space
with
equivariant
spin-structure
reduces
to
a
anthropic
approach
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem.
