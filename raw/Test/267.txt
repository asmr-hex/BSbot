Hawking
radiation
of
uncharged
and
charged
scalars
from
accelerating
and
rotating
black
holes
is
studied.
We
calculate
the
tunneling
probabilities
of
these
particles
from
the
rotation
and
acceleration
horizons
of
these
black
holes.
Using
the
tunneling
method
we
recover
the
correct
Hawking
temperature
as
well.
