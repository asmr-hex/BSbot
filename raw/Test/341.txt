Geometry
of
a
desingularization
of
eleven-dimensional
gravitational
spinors
\\
We
show
that
the
space
of
gravitational
spinors
in
eleven
dimensions,
defined
by
equations
$\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^i\lambda^{\alpha}\lambda^{\beta}=0$
admits
a
desingularization
with
nice
geometric
properties.
In
particular
the
desingularization
fibers
over
the
isotropic
Grassmannian
OGr(2,11).
This
enables
us
to
recast
equations
of
linearized
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
adapted
to
3-form
potential
into
Cauchy-Riemann
equations
on
a
super
extension
of
isotropic
Grassmannian
OGr(2,11).
