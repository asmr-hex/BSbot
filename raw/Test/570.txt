Holographic
description
of
three
dimensional
Godel
black
hole
\\
Three
dimensional
G\"{o}del
black
hole
is
a
solution
to
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theory
with
a
negative
cosmological
constant.
We
have
studied
the
hidden
conformal
symmetry
for
massive
scalar
field
without
any
additional
condition
in
the
background
of
three
dimensional
non-extremal
and
extremal
G\"{o}del
black
holes.
This
conformal
symmetry
is
uncovered
by
the
observation
that
the
radial
wave
equations
in
both
cases
can
all
be
rewritten
in
the
form
of
$SL(2,
R)$
Casimir
operators
through
introducing
two
sets
of
conformal
coordinates
to
write
the
$SL(2,
R)$
generators.
At
last,
we
give
the
holographic
dual
descriptions
of
Bekenstein-Hawking
entropies
of
non-extremal
and
extremal
black
holes
from
Cardy
formula
of
conformal
field
theory.
