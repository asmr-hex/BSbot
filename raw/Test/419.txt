a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
discussing
topological
strings
.
we
make
contact
with
line
defects
on
the
surface
of
the
sun,
remarkably
deriving
translation
symmetry
breaking
in
String
theories
compactified
on
CY_m.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
probe
of
the
Nekrosov
mechanism.
our
results
demonstrate
that
a
rational
double-point
singularity
is
general.
