Uniqueness
and
nonuniqueness
of
the
stationary
black
holes
in
5D
Einstein-Maxwell
and
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
gravity
\\
In
the
present
paper
we
investigate
the
general
problem
of
uniqueness
of
the
stationary
black
solutions
in
5D
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton
gravity
with
arbitrary
dilaton
coupling
parameter
containing
the
Einstein-Maxwell
gravity
as
a
particular
case.
We
formulate
and
prove
uniqueness
theorems
classifying
the
stationary
black
hole
solutions
in
terms
of
their
interval
structure,
electric
and
magnetic
charges
and
the
magnetic
fluxes.
The
proofs
are
based
on
the
nonpositivity
of
the
Riemann
curvature
operator
on
the
space
of
the
potentials
which
imposes
restrictions
on
the
dilaton
coupling
parameter.
