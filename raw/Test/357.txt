Brane
instantons
and
fluxes
in
F-theory
\\
We
study
the
combined
effect
of
world-volume
and
background
fluxes
on
Euclidean
D3-brane
instantons
in
F-theory
compactifications.
We
derive
an
appropriate
form
of
the
fermionic
effective
action,
in
which
the
fermions
are
topologically
twisted
and
the
dynamical
effect
of
fluxes,
non-trivial
axio-dilaton
and
warping
is
taken
into
account.
We
study
the
structure
of
fermionic
zero
modes,
which
determines
the
form
of
possible
non-perturbative
superpotential
and
F-terms
in
the
four-dimensional
effective
action.
Invariance
under
SL(2,Z)
is
discussed
in
detail,
which
allows
for
an
interpretation
of
the
results
in
terms
of
the
dual
M5-brane
instanton
in
the
M-theory
picture.
We
also
provide
the
perturbative
IIB
description
in
the
orientifold
limit,
when
available.
Furthermore,
we
consider
the
possible
inclusion
of
supersymmetry
breaking
bulk
fluxes
and
discuss
its
implications.
