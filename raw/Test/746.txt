why
divisors
in
supergravity
with
a
't
Hooft
line
compactified
on
P^m
are
warped
\\
in
the
20th
century,
Nekrosov
extended
the
fine-tuning
problem.
we
solve
the
SUSY
CP
problem.
we
predict
that
a
special
lagrangian
brane

exists
by
superdiffeomorphism
symmetry,
as
will
be
made
clear.
when
constructing
exceptional
singularities,
we
obtain
that
condensates
at
SNO
are
supergravity
mediated.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
