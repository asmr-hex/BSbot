The
Primary
Spin-4
Casimir
Operators
in
the
Holographic
SO(N)
Coset
Minimal
Models
\\
Starting
from
SO(N)
current
algebra,
we
construct
two
lowest
primary
higher
spin-4
Casimir
operators
which
are
quartic
in
spin-1
fields.
For
N
is
odd,
one
of
them
corresponds
to
the
current
in
the
WB_{\frac{N-1}{2}}
minimal
model.
For
N
is
even,
the
other
corresponds
to
the
current
in
the
WD_{\frac{N}{2}}
minimal
model.
These
primary
higher
spin
currents,
the
generators
of
wedge
subalgebra,
are
obtained
from
the
operator
product
expansion
of
fermionic
(or
bosonic)
primary
spin-N/2
field
with
itself
in
each
minimal
model
respectively.
We
obtain,
indirectly,
the
three-point
functions
with
two
real
scalars,
in
the
large
N
't
Hooft
limit,
for
all
values
of
the
't
Hooft
coupling
which
should
be
dual
to
the
three-point
functions
in
the
higher
spin
AdS_3
gravity
with
matter.
