The
Operator
Product
Expansion
of
the
Lowest
Higher
Spin
Current
at
Finite
N
\\
For
the
N=2
Kazama-Suzuki(KS)
model
on
CP^3,
the
lowest
higher
spin
current
with
spins
(2,
5/2,
5/2,3)
is
obtained
from
the
generalized
GKO
coset
construction.
By
computing
the
operator
product
expansion
of
this
current
and
itself,
the
next
higher
spin
current
with
spins
(3,
7/2,
7/2,
4)
is
also
derived.
This
is
a
realization
of
the
N=2
W_{N+1}
algebra
with
N=3
in
the
supersymmetric
WZW
model.
By
incorporating
the
self-coupling
constant
of
lowest
higher
spin
current
which
is
known
for
the
general
(N,k),
we
present
the
complete
nonlinear
operator
product
expansion
of
the
lowest
higher
spin
current
with
spins
(2,
5/2,
5/2,
3)
in
the
N=2
KS
model
on
CP^N
space.
This
should
coincide
with
the
asymptotic
symmetry
of
the
higher
spin
AdS_3
supergravity
at
the
quantum
level.
The
large
(N,k)
't
Hooft
limit
and
the
corresponding
classical
nonlinear
algebra
are
also
discussed.
