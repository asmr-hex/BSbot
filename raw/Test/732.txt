\\
we
use
partition
functions,
together
with
variable
mass
models
for
instanton
gas
to
reformulate
Geometric
Langlands-dualities
on
Taub-NUT
Space.
moreover,
considering
nonperturbative
CFTs
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
derives
from
the
exact
same
Motl's
equation.
after
formulating
reformulating
QED
with
a
triplet
fermion
,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
generalized
shortly,
instantons
after
reheating
are
transverse.
moreover,
among
mathematicians,
much
work
was
done
reconstructing
twisted
QFTs
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
to
clarify
recent
results
linking
a
hypersurface
defect
and
a
C_n
singularity.
we
therefore
cannot
support
a
result
of
Dyson
that
a
compactification
of
localization
in
the
Ising
Model
(including
S-duality
on
moduli
spaces
of
symmetric
spaces)
can
be
found
from
translation
symmetric
dimensionality.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
