Localization
of
Matter
Fields
in
the
6D
Standing
Wave
Braneworld
\\
We
introduce
new
6D
standing
wave
braneworld
model
generated
by
gravity
coupled
to
a
phantom-like
scalar
field
and
investigate
the
problem
of
pure
gravitational
localization
of
matter
fields.
We
show
that
in
the
case
of
increasing
warp
factor
spin
0,
1,
1/2
and
2
fields
are
localized
on
the
brane.
