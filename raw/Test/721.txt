Some
classes
of
renormalizable
tensor
models
\\
We
identify
new
families
of
renormalizable
of
tensor
models
from
anterior
renormalizable
tensor
models
via
a
mapping
capable
of
reducing
or
increasing
the
rank
of
the
theory
without
having
an
effect
on
the
renormalizability
property.
Mainly,
a
version
of
the
rank
3
tensor
model
as
defined
in
[
