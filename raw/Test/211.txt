New
superconformal
models
in
six
dimensions:
Gauge
group
and
representation
structure
\\
We
review
recent
progress
in
the
construction
and
classification
of
six-dimensional
(1,0)
superconformal
models
with
non-abelian
tensor
fields.
Here
we
solve
the
generalized
Jacobi
identities
which
are
required
for
consistency
of
the
non-abelian
vector/tensor
gauge
system
and
we
present
a
large
class
of
explicit
examples.
