The
odd
twistor
transform
in
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
\\
We
define
a
twistor-like
transform
of
the
equations
of
eleven-dimensional
supergravity.
More
precisely
these
equations
are
encoded
by
the
CR-structure
on
the
twistor
space
P^{2*15+11|8*2+16}.
In
addition
equations
of
the
linearized
eleven-dimensional
supergravity
adapted
to
the
3-form
potential
can
be
transformed
into
the
tangential
Cauchy-Riemann
equation
d
omega=0
on
P.
