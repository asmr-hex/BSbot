SL(2,Z)
Action
on
AdS/BCFT
and
Hall
Conductivities
\\
We
study
the
response
of
a
conserved
current
to
external
electromagnetic
fields
in
a
holographic
system
with
boundaries
using
the
recently
proposed
AdS/BCFT
(boundary
conformal
field
theory)
framework.
This,
in
particular,
allows
us
to
extract
the
Hall
current,
the
Hall
conductivity,
plus
some
potentially
novel
transport
coefficients,
and
relations
among
them.
We
also
analyze
the
action
of
SL(2,Z)
duality
in
the
gravity
bulk,
which
acts
non-trivially
on
the
conductivity
of
the
BCFT.
Finally
we
consider
a
type
IIA
string
theory
embedding
of
our
setup.
