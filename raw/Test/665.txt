The
FGK
formalism
for
black
p-branes
in
d
dimensions
\\
We
present
a
generalization
to
an
arbitrary
number
of
spacetime
(d)
and
worldvolume
(p+1)
dimensions
of
the
formalism
proposed
by
Ferrara,
Gibbons
and
Kallosh
to
study
black
holes
(p=0)
in
d=4
dimensions.
We
include
the
special
cases
in
which
there
can
be
dyonic
and
self-
or
anti-self-dual
black
branes.
Most
of
the
results
valid
for
4-dimensional
black
holes
(relations
between
temperature,
entropy
and
non-extremality
parameter,
and
between
entropy
and
black-hole
potential
on
the
horizon)
are
straightforwardly
generalized.
