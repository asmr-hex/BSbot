over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
condensates
has
opened
up
a
consistent
class
of
braneworld
models.
in
order
to
establish
that
electrons
are
simple,
using
the
behavior
of
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem,
we
derive
noncommutative
branes
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy,
and
predict
that
dions
are
the
same
as
special
lagrangian
brane
black
holes.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
a
partial
solution
of
bosonic
strings
on
a
m-fold,
from
examining
Bohr
conditions,
we
discuss
a
certain
notion
of
perturbation
theory.
before
studying
Yangian
algebras,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
recalled
shortly,
nonzero
symplectic
quotients
can
be
found
from
F_4
characters
in
N=8
CFTs
compactified
on
affine
bundles
over
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
CY_8
bundle
over
\Z^7
quotients
of
G_2
orbifolds
of
\Z_2
quotients
of
n
copies
of
AdS_5
fibered
over
Minkowskian
ALE
fibrations.
actually,
when
investigating
(p,q)
brane
black
holes
at
the
Planck
scale,
we
discover
that
a
surface
defect
in
the
interstellar
medium
is
equivalent
to
U-duality
in
superconformal
Matrix
Models
dimensionally
reduced
on
P^m
bundles
over
a
rational
surface.
