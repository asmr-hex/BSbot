partial
approaches
to
the
LHC
inverse
problem
\\
among
mathematicians,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
Motl
unparticle
physics
in
order
to
avoid
surveying
particle
fluctuations
in
the
interstellar
medium.
we
take
a
longitudinal
approach.
thus,
partial
progress
has
been
made
over
the
last
decade
understanding
unparticle
physics
with
a
nonlocal
F-term
compactified
on
a
E_8
bundle
over
8-folds.
we
shed
light
on
why
evaluating
the
non-braneworld
Landau-Ginzburg
Model
is
inconsistent.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
T-duality
in
models
of
neutrinos.
our
results
determine
that
an
orientifold
plane
is
Lorentz
symmetric,
by
symmetry.
therefore,
du
Val
singularities
after
reheating
can
be
interpreted
as
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
