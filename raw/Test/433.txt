General
holographic
superconductor
models
with
backreactions
\\
We
study
general
models
of
holographic
superconductors
away
from
the
probe
limit.
We
find
that
the
backreaction
of
the
spacetime
can
bring
richer
physics
in
the
phase
transition.
Moreover
we
observe
that
the
ratio
$\omega_g/T_c$
changes
with
the
strength
of
the
backreaction
and
is
not
a
universal
constant.
