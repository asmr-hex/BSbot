Finite
Temperature
Structure
of
the
Compactified
Standard
Model
\\
We
analyze
the
finite
temperature
structure
of
the
standard
model
coupled
to
gravity
with
one
and
two
dimensions
compactified
(on
a
circle
and
a
torus).
We
find
that
finite
temperature
effects
wash
out
any
vacua
which
exist
at
zero
temperature.
We
also
discuss
the
possibility
of
transitions
between
the
four-dimensional
universe
and
the
lower-dimensional
spacetimes.
