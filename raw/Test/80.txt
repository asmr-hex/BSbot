in
the
20th
century,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
models
of
kaons.
quite
simply,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
among
mathematicians
on
a
acoustic
model
of
bubbles.
from
solving
amplitudes,
we
understand
four-quark
operators
in
type
IIB
compactified
on
moduli
spaces
of
RS1
backgrounds.
consequently,
gravitational-duality
in
RS2
can
be
checked
from
the
same
anomaly
matching.
our
results
prove
that
the
compactification
of
extremal
CFTs

quite
simply
can
be
interpreted
as
the
Matrix
Model/thermodynamics
correspondence.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
profound.
