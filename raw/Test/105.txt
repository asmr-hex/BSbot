Octonionic

\\
Using
algebraic
tools
inspired
by
the
study
of
nilpotent
orbits
in
simple
Lie
algebras,
we
obtain
a
large
class
of
solutions
describing
interacting
non-BPS
black
holes
in
N=8
supergravity,
which
depend
on
44
harmonic
functions.
For
this
purpose,
we
consider
a
truncation
E6(6)
/
Sp(8,R)
of
the
non-linear
sigma
model
describing
stationary
solutions
of
the
theory,
which
permits
a
reduction
of
algebraic
computations
to
the
multiplication
of
27
by
27
matrices.
The
lift
to
N=8
supergravity
is
then
carried
out
without
loss
of
information
by
using
a
pertinent
representation
of
the
moduli
parametrizing
E7(7)
/
SU(8)
in
terms
of
complex
valued
Hermitian
matrices
over
the
split
octonions,
which
generalise
the
projective
coordinates
of
exceptional
special
Kaehler
manifolds.
We
extract
the
electromagnetic
charges,
mass
and
angular
momenta
of
the
solutions,
and
exhibit
the
duality
invariance
of
the
black
holes
distance
separations.
We
discuss
in
particular
a
new
type
of
interaction
which
appears
when
interacting
non-BPS
black
holes
are
not
aligned.
Finally
we
will
explain
the
possible
generalisations
toward
the
description
of
the
most
general
stationary
black
hole
solutions
of
N=8
supergravity.
