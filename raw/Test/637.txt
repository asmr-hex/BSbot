Divergences
in
QFT
on
the
Noncommutative
Minkowski
Space
with
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
potential
\\
We
study
quantum
field
theory
on
the
two-dimensional
Noncommutative
Minkoswki
space
with
a
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
potential.
We
explicitly
construct
the
retarded
propagator
and
show
that
it
is
not
a
tempered
distribution.
This
leads
to
problems
when
trying
to
define
planar
products
of
such
distributions,
as
they
appear
in
the
Yang-Feldman
series.
At
and
above
the
self-dual
point,
these
can
no
longer
be
defined,
not
even
at
different
points.
This
shows
that
we
do
not
deal
with
an
ordinary
ultraviolet
divergence.
