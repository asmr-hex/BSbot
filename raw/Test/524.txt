Intersecting
Brane
Vacua
and
Non-perturbative
Transitions
\\
We
discuss
the
process
of
transmutation
of
branes
into
Abelian
magnetic
flux
on
the
worldvolume
of
$D9$
branes.
This
phenomenon
is
T-dual
to
the
recombination
of
branes
in
the
intersecting-brane
description.
In
the
low
energy
limit
this
can
be
described
by
a
Higgs
mechanism
involving
bifundamental
scalars.
The
Abelian
magnetic
background
arises
as
a
consequence
of
the
compactness
of
the
internal
space.
Explicit
(six-dimensional)
examples
based
on
the
supersymmetric
and
the
Brane
Supersymmetry
Breaking
(BSB)
$\mathbb{T}^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$
orientifold
are
analyzed.
