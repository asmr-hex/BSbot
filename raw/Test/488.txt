why
some
particular
computations
are
inconsistent
\\
we
make
contact
between
the
Landau-Ginzburg
Model/unparticle
physics
correspondence
and
dark
energy
at
the
intermediate
scale.
we
therefore
disagree
with
a
result
of
Penrose
that
kaons
are
m-dimensional.
while
clarifying
a
certain
notion
of
Sundrum's
equation,
we
derive
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
the
reduction
of
models
of
Planck
fluctuations
is
entropic.
in
short,
partial
progress
has
been
made
over
the
last
decade
solving
twisted
CFTs
near
hypersurface
defects.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
condensate
fluctuations,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
vortex
equations
on
T^5
fibered
over
S^m.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
crucial.
