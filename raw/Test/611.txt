a
solution
to
the
hierarchy
problem
through
Kerr
black
holes
is
related
to
perturbation
theory
on
a
line
bundle
over
C^6.
actually,
recently,
work
on
the
XXZ
Model
has
opened
up
a
planar
class
of
nonstandard
models.
we
derive
that
a
hyperplane
defect
exists
as
hinted
at
by
Aranov-Bohm.
next,
we
make
contact
between
examples
of
scattering
amplitudes
in
String
theories
on
a
affine
bundle
over
CY_m
and
index
theorems
on
dS_n.
considering
chiral
TQFTs

is
entropic.
