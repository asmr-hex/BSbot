A
Generalized
Gauge
Theory
of
Gravity
\\
In
this
paper,
we
discuss
a
gravitational
theory
based
on
the
generalized
gauge
field.
Our
Lagrangian
is
invariant
not
only
under
local
Lorentz
transformation
and
the
ordinary
gauge
transformation
but
also
under
a
new
gauge
transformation.
We
show
that
the
gauge
field
associated
with
this
new
transformation
is
a
second-rank
tensor
field
and
that
the
Einstein-Hilbert
term
can
be
derived
from
our
Lagrangian
when
the
gauge
field
has
a
vacuum
expectation
value.
We
also
show
that
our
model
provides
a
Lagrangian
for
the
scalar-tensor
theory.
