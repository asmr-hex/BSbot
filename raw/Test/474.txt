Singlet
Vector
Models
on
Lens
Spaces
\\
We
present
exact
computations
of
partition
functions
of
singlet
vector
models
(infinite
level
Chern-Simons-matter
theories)
on
lens
spaces
L(p,
1).
We
identify
light
topological
configurations
and
their
spectra,
and
we
comment
on
the
relevance
of
our
results
in
studying
both
the
UV
completions
of
Vasiliev's
higher-spin
theories
and
the
dS/CFT
correspondence
in
the
large
N
limit.
