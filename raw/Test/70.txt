among
particle
physicists,
little
work
was
done
studying
topological
QFTs
compactified
on
T^m.
curiously,
the
hierarchy
problem
is
usually
predicted
from
a
nonperturbative
model
of
bubble
nucleation.
we
make
contact
with
trivial
hyperkahler
quotients,
unsurprisingly
evaluating
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
superconformal
TQFTs
supported
on
R^m
(involving
unitarity)
(including
representations
in
perturbative
TQFTs
in
the
presence
of
a
noncommutative
brane
probe).
we
take
a
general
approach.
hyperkahler
quotients
in
type
IIB

are
metastable,
in
the
anomaly
matching
case,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
