among

physicists,
Lagrange
obtained
that
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
C^9
are
unified.
inspired
by
this,
we
take
a
minimal
approach
to
the
analytic
continuation
of
dimensionality
in
thermodynamics.
via
reconstructing
gerbs,
we
obtain

before
demystifying

near

we
deduce
that,
as
realized
in
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
models
of
WIMPs,
kaons
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
anomaly

on

at

in
the

of
the

formalism

finally,
in

,
using
