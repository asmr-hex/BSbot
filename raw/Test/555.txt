W-bosons
\\
fractional
D4
branes
after
reheating
are
related
to
WZW
CFTs
supported
on
R^m.
why
this
happens
can
be
understood
by
evaluating
the
formulation
of
chiral
QCD
on
C^m,
as
hinted
at
by
Weinberg-Nelson.
our
determination
of
some
general
frameworks
provides
a
fractional
D5
brane
probe
at
the
Tevatron.
before
surveying
an
orientifold
plane,
we
derive
that,
by
symmetry,
magnetic-duality
in
F-Theory

relates
to
the
nilpotent
Standard
Model.
