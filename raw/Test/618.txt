Making
predictions
in
the
multiverse
\\
I
describe
reasons
to
think
we
are
living
in
an
eternally
inflating
multiverse
where
the
observable
"constants"
of
nature
vary
from
place
to
place.
The
major
obstacle
to
making
predictions
in
this
context
is
that
we
must
regulate
the
infinities
of
eternal
inflation.
I
review
a
number
of
proposed
regulators,
or
measures.
Recent
work
has
ruled
out
a
number
of
measures
by
showing
that
they
conflict
with
observation,
and
focused
attention
on
a
few
proposals.
Further,
several
different
measures
have
been
shown
to
be
equivalent.
I
describe
some
of
the
many
nontrivial
tests
these
measures
will
face
as
we
learn
more
from
theory,
experiment,
and
observation.
