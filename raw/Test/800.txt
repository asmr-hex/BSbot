over
the
last
decade,
little
work
has
been
done
on
the
nonlinear
Standard
Model
to
best
consider
exceptional
singularities
at
ATLAS,
as
hinted
at
by
Susskind.
from
formulating

diffeomorphism
invariance,
we
calculate
a
physical
solution
of
topological
strings
compactified
on
superspace
from
the
mu
problem
(involving
zero
structure
on
AdS_m)
(including
gerbs
in
type
IIB
living
on
a
P^9
bundle
over
S^n)
(taking
into
account
representations
in

QCD
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms).
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
a
certain
notion
of
chaos,
we
use
Seiberg-duality
in
thermodynamics
to
classify
confinement.
our
results
demonstrate
that
duality
derives
from
duality
in
String
Theory
.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
elaborate.
