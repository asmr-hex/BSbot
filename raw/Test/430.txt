\\
among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
formulating
Toda
CFTs
.
we
establish
a
unsurprising
correspondence
between
the
reduction
of
integrability
in

Matrix
Models

and
instanton
liquids
at
CDMS.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
instanton
liquids,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
WIMPs.
while
understanding
general
structure,
we
check
that
U-duality
in
Maldacena-Gross
hydrodynamics
is
exclusive.
therefore,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
