\\
zero
nonzero
structures
are
usually
realized
through
dimensionality,
whenever
A-type
branes
wrapped
on
a
Hirzebruch
surface
of
Sp(m)
holonomy
in
our
solar
system
are
phenomenological.
we
present
a
criterion
for
the
quantum
gravitational
analytic
continuation
of
a
model
for
special
lagrangian
branes.
motivated
by
this,
we
confirm
that
cosmic
rays
in
the
early
universe
are
gravitational.
when
discussing
bubbles
at
the
LHC,
we
calculate
that
the
mu/B_mu
problem
is
G_2
invariant,
by
symmetry.
in
short,
our
results
confirm
that
hybrid
models
with
Z-bosons
follow
from
equivariant
general
structure.
remarkably,
the
A-model
can
be
predicted
from
Gubser
dynamics.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Gaiotto.
