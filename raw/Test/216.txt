Non-Hermitian
$\cal
PT$-symmetric
relativistic
Quantum
mechanics
with
a
maximal
mass
in
an
external
magnetic
field
\\
Starting
with
the
modified
Dirac
equations
for
free
massive
particles
with
the
$\gamma_5$-extension
of
the
physical
mass
$m\rightarrow
m_1
+
\gamma_5
m_2$,
we
consider
equations
of
relativistic
quantum
mechanics
in
the
presence
of
an
external
electromagnetic
field.
The
new
approach
is
developing
on
the
basis
of
existing
methods
for
study
the
unbroken
$\cal
PT$
symmetry
of
Non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians.
The
paper
shows
that
this
modified
model
contains
the
definition
of
the
mass
parameter,
which
may
use
as
the
determination
of
the
magnitude
scaling
of
energy
$M$.
Obviously
that
the
transition
to
the
standard
approach
is
valid
when
small
in
comparison
with
$M$
energies
and
momenta.
Formally,
this
limit
is
performed
when
$M\rightarrow\infty$,
which
simultaneously
should
correspond
to
the
transition
to
a
\emph{Hermitian
limit}$m_2\rightarrow
0$.
Inequality
$m
\leq
M$
may
be
considered
and
as
the
restriction
of
the
mass
spectrum
of
fermions
considered
in
the
model.
Within
of
this
approach,
the
effects
of
possible
\emph{observability}
mass
parameters:
$m_1,
m_2$,
$M$
are
investigated
taking
into
account
the
interaction
of
the
magnetic
field
with
charged
fermions
together
with
the
accounting
of
their
anomalous
magnetic
moments.
