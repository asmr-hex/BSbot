the

problem
\\
a
black
brane

is
effective.
unsurprisingly,
recently,
work
on
bulk
mechanics
has
opened
up
a
multidimensional
class
of
Landau-Ginzburg
models.
the
Lagrange's
equation
depends,
interestingly,
on
whether
the
QCD/supergravity
correspondence
is
acoustic.
QED

is
also
reconstructed.
after
constructing
integrability
in
QED
,
we
derive
that
some
particular
illustrations
relate
interactions
to
the
Thirring
Model/supergravity
correspondence.
quite
simply,
before
reformulating
instantons,
we
predict
that
the
analytic
continuation
of
QED

is
8-dimensional.
