Seiberg-like
duality
in
three
dimensions
for
orthogonal
gauge
groups
\\
We
propose
a
duality
for
N=2
d=3
Chern-Simons
gauge
theories
with
orthogonal
gauge
groups
and
matter
in
the
vector
representation.
This
duality
generalizes
level-rank
duality
for
pure
Chern-Simons
gauge
theories
with
orthogonal
gauge
groups
and
is
reminiscent
of
Seiberg
duality
in
four
dimensions.
We
perform
extensive
checks
by
comparing
partition
functions
of
theories
related
by
dualities.
We
also
determine
the
conformal
dimensions
of
fields
using
Z-extremization.
