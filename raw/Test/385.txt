Gauged
M-flation,
its
UV
sensitivity
and
Spectator
Species
\\
In
this
paper
we
study
gauged
M-flation,
an
inflationary
model
in
which
inflation
is
driven
by
three
NxN
scalar
field
matrices
in
the
adjoint
representation
of
U(N)
gauge
group.
We
focus
our
study
on
the
gauged
M-flation
model
which
could
be
derived
from
the
dynamics
of
a
stack
of
D3-branes
in
appropriate
background
flux.
The
background
inflationary
dynamics
is
unaltered
compared
to
the
ungauged
case
of
