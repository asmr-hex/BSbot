Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
a
model
of
bubble
nucleation
depends
on
duality.
therefore,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
on
metastable
models
.
next,
we
determine
that
some
conspicuous
computations
are
calculable.
moreover,
the
supergravity/supergravity
correspondence
is
phenomenological.
