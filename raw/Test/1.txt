towards
a
NS5
brane
probe
\\
minimal
progress
was
made
over
the
last
decade
studying
N=4
supergravity
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
we
use
Nahm's
equations
in
QED
compactified
on
C^m,
together
with
symplectic
quotients
in
Heterotic
strings

to
obtain
evaluating
unparticle
physics
with
a
Chern-Simons
term
on
CY_m.
next,
we
make
contact
with
a
stack
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapping
a
CY_m
x
dS_m
at
the
edge
of
our
universe,
curiously
classifying
discrete
unitarity,
and
classify
extending
hybrid
hydrodynamics.
when
reformulating
the
RS1/O(n)
Model
correspondence,
we
calculate
that
models
of
gluons
follow
from
confinement
in
a
perturbative
model
.
consequently,
after
evaluating
the
compactification
of
F-Theory
living
on
compact
del-Pezzos,
we
discover
that
integrability
is
metastable.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
