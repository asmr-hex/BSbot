Soliton-antisoliton
pair
production
in
particle
collisions
\\
We
propose
general
semiclassical
method
for
computing
the
probability
of
soliton-antisoliton
pair
production
in
particle
collisions.
The
method
is
illustrated
by
explicit
numerical
calculations
in
(1+1)-dimensional
scalar
field
model.
We
find
that
the
probability
of
the
process
is
suppressed
by
an
exponentially
small
factor
which
is
almost
constant
at
high
energies.
