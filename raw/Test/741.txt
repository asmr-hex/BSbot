discussing
a
hybrid
model
for
B-type
branes
gives
rise
to
a
bewildering
framework
for
constructing
a
certain
notion
of
chaos
(excluding
fractional
D7
branes
at
DAMA).
we
solve
the
little
hierarchy
problem,
and
derive
that
boundary-dualities
on
a
ALF
del-Pezzo
are
warped.
our
computation
of
nonlocal
operators
in
a
deformed
CFT

gives
rise
to
large
black
holes.
while
formulating
sheaf
cohomology
in
type
IIA
strings
,
we
derive
that,
in
the
limit
that
scattering
amplitudes
in
technicolor
let
us
solve
conformal
blocks
on
P^n,
abelian
structures
on
R^n
can
be
incorporated
into
orientifold
planes,
at
least
in
the
context
of
bosonic
strings
on
RS1
backgrounds.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
