All
orders
renormalizability
of
a
Lorentz
and
CPT
violating
quantum
electrodynamics
\\
Renormalizability
of
the
(minimal)
single-fermion
QED
extension
is
investigated
at
all
orders
of
perturbation
theory
in
the
framework
of
algebraic
renormalization,
a
regularization-independent
method.
Relative
to
the
standard
QED,
new
structures
that
could
lead
to
gauge
anomalies
are
identified.
Nevertheless,
even
if
the
anomaly
coefficients
fail
to
vanish
in
the
general
case,
they
shall
be
absent
provided
we
require
invariance
of
the
action
under
C
and/or
PT
transformations.
Stability
is
also
verified
in
this
case,
hence
full
renormalizability
is
attained.
