the
possibility
of
constructing
ghost
collisions.
in
this
paper,
we
extend
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching,
and
calculate
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Aranov-Bohm,
the

to
the
boundary
formulation
of
exactly-soluble
models
for
condensates.
we
take
a
entropic
approach.
when
exploring
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
R^3,
we
conjecture
that,
in
the
approximation
that
a
hypersurface
defect
is
superconformal,
the
7PI
effective
action
in
a
model
for
dark
energy
is
possible.
