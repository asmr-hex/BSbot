Holography
of
Species
in
Cascading
DGP
\\
In
this
paper
we
generalize
the
idea
of
species
holography
to
the
case
of
Cascading
DGP
theories.
Essence
of
the
phenomenon
is
that
a
4D
field
theory
with
N
particle
species
coupled
to
a
high-dimensional
bulk
gravity
propagating
solely
a
graviton
becomes
strongly
coupled
at
the
scale
that
would
be
the
quantum
gravity
scale
of
the
bulk
theory
if
all
the
species
were
propagating
in
the
bulk.
We
will
see
that
both,
crossover
scales
and
Vainshtein
scales,
can
be
understood
as
holographic
scales
in
the
above
sense.
We
confirm
our
results
by
an
explicit
effective
field
theoretic
derivation
of
these
scales
in
Cascading
DGP.
