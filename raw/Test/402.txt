Relativistic
invariance
of
the
vacuum
\\
Relativistic
invariance
of
the
vacuum
is
(or
follows
from)
one
of
the
Wightman
axioms
which
is
commonly
believed
to
be
true.
Without
these
axioms,
here
we
present
a
direct
and
general
proof
of
continuous
relativistic
invariance
of
all
real-time
vacuum
correlations
of
fields,
not
only
scattering
(forward
in
time),
based
on
closed
time
path
formalism.
The
only
assumptions
are
basic
principles
of
relativistic
quantum
field
theories:
the
relativistic
invariance
of
the
Lagrangian,
of
the
form
including
known
interactions
(electromagnetic,
weak
and
strong),
and
standard
rules
of
quantization.
The
proof
is
in
principle
perturbative
leaving
a
possibility
of
spontaneous
violation
of
invariance.
Time
symmetry
is
however
manifestly
violated.
