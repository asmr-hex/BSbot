in
short,
in
the
20th
century,
much
work
has
been
done
on
nonperturbative
anomaly
mediation
to
generalize
charginos.
our
determination
of
models
of
cosmic
rays
gives
the
anomaly
mediated
extension
of
M-Theory
.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
hyperkahler
quotients
in
type
IIA
deformed
by
relevant
F-terms.
after
exploring
discussing
QCD
with
antisymmetric
tensor
fermions
on
Spin(7)
orbifolds
of
symmetric
spaces
fibered
over
C^n,
we
predict
that
models
of
cosmic
rays
are
gauge
mediated.
