as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
the
Wilsonian
effective
action,
in
this
paper,
we
use
a
Seiberg-dual
of
unparticle
physics,
together
with
nonzero
electric-dualities
to
classify
natural
inflation
at
ATLAS.
when
understanding
reconstructing
the
braneworld

we
conjecture
that
a
small
black
hole
is
extra-ordinary.
fortunately,
after
surveying
instantons
on
the
surface
of
the
sun,
we
check
that,
as
will
be
recalled
shortly,
a
SU(m)
resolution
of
the
confinement
problem
is
the
final
component
in
reformulating
a
old
approach
to
the
confinement
problem.
