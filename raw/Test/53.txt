Supersymmetric
theories
on
squashed
five-sphere
\\
We
construct
supersymmetric
theories
on
the
SU(3)xU(1)
symmetric
squashed
five-sphere
with
2,
4,
6,
and
12
supercharges.
We
first
determine
the
Killing
equation
by
dimensional
reduction
from
6d,
and
use
Noether
procedure
to
construct
actions.
The
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
action
is
straightforwardly
obtained
from
the
supersymmetric
Chern-Simons
action
by
using
a
supersymmetry
preserving
constant
vector
multiplet.
