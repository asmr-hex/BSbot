Transition
Amplitudes
in
de

Space
\\
Maldacena
has
shown
that
the
wavefunction
of
the
universe
in
de
Sitter
space
can
be
viewed
as
the
partition
function
of
a
conformal
field
theory.
In
this
paper,
we
investigate
this
approach
to
the
dS/CFT
correspondence
in
further
detail.
We
emphasize
that
massive
bulk
fields
are
dual
to
two
primary
operators
on
the
boundary,
which
encode
information
about
the
two
independent
behaviors
of
bulk
expectation
values
at
late
times.
An
operator
statement
of
the
duality
is
given,
and
it
is
shown
that
the
resulting
boundary
correlators
can
be
interpreted
as
transition
amplitudes
from
the
Bunch-Davies
vacuum
to
an
excited
state
in
the
infinite
future.
We
also
explain
how
these
scattering
amplitudes
can
be
used
to
compute
late-time
Bunch-Davies
expectation
values,
and
comment
on
the
effects
of
anomalies
in
the
dual
CFT
on
such
expectation
values.
