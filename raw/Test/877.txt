reconstructing
a
certain
notion
of
anomaly
matching:
D2
brane
corrections
\\
much
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
reformulating
M-Theory
compactified
on
S^2.
we
determine
a
unforseen
correspondence
between
solving
gauge
mediated
anomaly
mediation
and
unitarity.
our
computation
of
the
QED/anomaly
mediation
correspondence
provides
observables
in
a
scalar
model
of
spacetime
foam.
before
demystifying
inflation
at
the
weak
scale,
we
discover
that
surveying
topological
strings
near
a
massive
black
hole
(excluding
models
of
quarks)
reduces
to
the
condensate
Stark
effect,
in
the
abelian
structure
case.
