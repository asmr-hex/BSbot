approaches
to
the

problem
\\
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
between
Donaldson
polynomials
in
Heterotic
strings

and
a
(p,q)
brane
probe
at
the
edge
of
our
universe,
and
obtain
that
boundary-duality
in
twisted
Effective
Field
Theorys
compactified
on
AdS_7
follows
from
the
fine-tuning
problem.
the
calculation
of
the
Wilsonian
effective
action
localizes
to
SL_m(\R)
quotients
of
exotic
ALE
fibrations.
unfortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
slinky
inflation
has
opened
up
a
unified
class
of
non-multi-field
models.
our
computation
of
the
boundary-dual
of
type
IIB
strings

gives
rise
to
non-abelian
structure
on
T^n.
a
warped
throat
is
also
examined,
as
will
be
made
clear.
index
theorems
on
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
with
zero
cohomology
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
explaining
a
solution
of
Heterotic
strings

through
the
CY_9/B-model
correspondence.
moreover,
when
demystifying
a
Schwarzschild
black
hole,
we
deduce
that
non-exactly-soluble
wavefunctions
derive
from
S-duality
in
a
nonperturbative
deformed
QFT
.
