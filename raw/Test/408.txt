On
W-algebras
and
the
symmetries
of
defects
of
6d
N=(2,0)
theory
\\
We
consider
6d
N=(2,0)
theory
on
N
M5-branes,
together
with
a
4d
defect
labeled
by
a
Young
diagram
Y
specifying
its
global
symmetry
G_Y.
A
recent
conjecture
states
that
a
compactification
of
this
system
leads
to
a
2d
theory
with
W-algebra
symmetry
depending
on
Y.
We
provide
a
check
of
the
conjecture
by
reproducing
the
level
of
the
current
subalgebra
\hat{G}_Y
of
this
W-algebra
from
the
property
of
the
4d
defect.
