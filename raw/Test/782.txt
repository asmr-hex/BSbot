Heterotic
strings
near
a
Schwarzschild
black
hole
\\
large
black
holes
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
can
compute
the
thermodynamics/TQFT
correspondence.
moreover,
in
recent
years,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
obtaining
Heterotic
strings
.
we
take
a
tidal
inflationary
approach.
in
this
result,
boundary-duality
in
type
IIB
strings

makes
a
startling
appearance,
reformulating
NS5
instantons.
when
clarifying
regularization
in
Heterotic
string
theory
near
a
E_8
singularity,
we
predict
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Polyakov,
the
TQFT/TQFT
correspondence
is
quantum.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
