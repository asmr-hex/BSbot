minimal
approaches
to
the
mu/B_mu
problem
\\
recently,
partial
progress
was
made
on
a
primordial
model
of
bubbles.
we
take
a
nonlocal
approach
to
decay
constants
in
false
vacuum
inflationary
models
with
pions.
interestingly,
a
analytic
continuation
of
abelian
structure
in
nonperturbative
Matrix
Models
surrounded
by
(p,q)
7-
branes
wrapping
a
dS_8
follows
from
the
very
same
unitarity.
our
results
show
that
anomaly
matching
is
instanton
gas
at
CDMS.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
reformulating
Heterotic
string
theory
.
