Tensor
Network
and
Black
Hole
\\
A
tensor
network
formalism
of
thermofield
dynamics
is
introduced.
The
formalism
relates
the
original
Hilbert
space
with
its
tilde
space
by
a
product
of
two
copies
of
a
tensor
network.
Then,
their
interface
becomes
an
event
horizon,
and
the
logarithm
of
the
tensor
rank
corresponds
to
the
black
hole
entropy.
Eventually,
multiscale
entanglement
renormalization
anzats
(MERA)
reproduces
an
AdS
black
hole
at
finite
temperature.
Our
finding
shows
rich
functionalities
of
MERA
as
efficient
graphical
representation
of
AdS/CFT
correspondence.
