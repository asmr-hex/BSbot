Techniques
arising
from
string
theory
can
be
used
to
study
assemblies
of
strongly-interacting
fermions.
Via
this
`holographic
duality',
various
strongly-coupled
many
body
systems
are
solved
using
an
auxiliary
theory
of
gravity.
Simple
holographic
realizations
of
finite
density
exhibit
single-particle
spectral
functions
with
sharp
Fermi
surfaces,
of
a
form
distinct
from
those
of
the
Landau
theory.
The
self-energy
is
given
by
a
correlation
function
in
an
infrared
fixed
point
theory
which
is
represented
by
an
AdS_2
region
in
the
dual
gravitational
description.
Here
we
describe
in
detail
the
gravity
calculation
of
this
IR
correlation
function.
