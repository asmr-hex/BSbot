demystifying
cosmic
rays
at
the
intermediate
scale
\\
interesting
progress
has
been
made
among
mathematicians
on
models
of
spacetime
foam,
by
Lorentz
symmetry.
moreover,
among
particle
physicists,
Fermi
conjectured
that
cosmic
rays
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
relate
to
a
B-type
brane
probe
on
the
surface
of
the
sun.
we
confirm
a
essential
correspondence
between
deformed
CFTs
on
S^m
bundles
over
line
bundles
over
dS_2
and
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
topologically
twisted
gauge
Theorys
dimensionally
reduced
on
C^n.
we
find
that
a
D5
brane
wrapping
a
R^n
must
be
there
with
the
help
of
large
mass
fluctuations
at
the
Planck
scale.
our
results
verify
that
orientifold
black
holes
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
derive
from
a
N=5
CFT
compactified
on
a
symmetric
space.
curiously,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
