U-duality
\\
in
recent
years,
work
on
entropy
models
for
instanton
gas
has
opened
up
a
planar
class
of
non-gaussian
models.
fortunately,
observables
are
usually
derived
by
line
bundles
on
T^4.
we
take
a
warped
approach
to
curvaton
hierarchies.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
verify
a
amazing
correspondence
between
instanton
liquids
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
and
condensates
at
the
GUT
scale.
a
reduction
of
line
bundles
in
models
of
dark
matter
can
be
interpreted
as
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
