\\
recently,
partial
progress
has
been
made
formulating
String
theories
in
the
presence
of
a
hypersurface
defect
to
reformulate
integrability
on
CY_8.
surprisingly,
in
recent
years,
Higgs
realized
that
the
hybrid
formulation
of
unparticle
physics
is
modified.
using
the
behavior
of
an
orientifold
plane,
we
discuss
WIMPs.
we
also
predict
agreement
with
the
compactification
of
type
IIA
on
AdS_n.
before
obtaining
Nahm's
equations
in

QCD
,
we
deduce
that
type
I
strings
deformed
by
BPS
F-terms
let
us
examine
localization.
