Chern-Simons
Spinor
Electrodynamics
in
the
Light-Cone
Gauge
\\
The
one-loop
quantum
corrections
of
Chern-Simons
spinor
electrodynamics
in
the
light-cone
gauge
has
been
investigated.
We
have
calculated
the
vacuum
polarization
tensor,
fermionic
self-energy
and
on-shell
vertex
correction
with
a
hybrid
regularization
consisting
of
a
higher
covariant
derivative
regularization
and
dimensional
continuation.
The
Mandelstam-Leibbrandt
prescription
is
used
to
handle
the
spurious
light-cone
singularity
in
the
gauge
field
propagator.
We
then
perform
the
finite
renormalization
to
define
the
quantum
theory.
The
generation
of
the
parity-even
Maxwell
term
and
the
arising
of
anomalous
magnetic
moment
from
quantum
corrections
are
reproduced
as
in
the
case
of
a
covariant
gauge
choice.
The
Ward
identities
in
the
light-cone
gauge
are
verified
to
satisfy
explicitly.
Further,
we
have
found
the
light-cone
vector
dependent
sector
of
local
quantum
effective
action
for
the
fermion
is
explicitly
gauge
invariant,
and
hence
the
covariance
of
$S$-matrix
elements
of
the
theory
can
be
achieved.
