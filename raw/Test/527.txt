String
theory
embeddings
of
non-relativistic
field
theories
and
their
holographic
Horava
gravity
duals
\\
We
argue
that
generic
non-relativistic
quantum
field
theories
have
a
holographic
description
in
terms
of
Horava
gravity.
We
construct
explicit
examples
of
this
duality
embedded
in
string
theory
by
starting
with
relativistic
dual
pairs
and
taking
a
non-relativistic
scaling
limit.
