Super-renormalizable
Higher-Derivative
Quantum
Gravity
\\
In
this
paper
we
study
perturbatively
an
extension
of
the
Stelle
higher
derivative
gravity
involving
an
infinite
number
of
derivative
terms.
We
know
that
the
usual
quadratic
action
is
renormalizable
but
is
not
unitary
because
of
the
presence
of
a
ghost
in
the
theory
(pole
with
negative
residue
in
the
propagator).
The
new
theory
is
instead
ghost-free
since
an
entire
function
(or
form
factor)
is
introduced
in
the
model
without
involving
new
poles
in
the
propagator.
The
local
high
derivative
theory
is
recovered
expanding
the
entire
functions
to
the
lowest
order
in
the
mass
scale
of
the
theory.
Any
truncation
of
the
entire
function
gives
rise
to
unitarity
violation.
The
theory
is
divergent
at
one
loop
and
finite
from
two
loops
upwards:
the
theory
is
then
super-renormalizable.
Using
the
modified
graviton
propagator,
we
demonstrate
the
regularity
of
the
gravitational
potential
in
r=0.
