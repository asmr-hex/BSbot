Degeneracy
induced
scaling
of
the
correlation
length
for
periodic
models
\\
The
broken
symmetric
phase
of
scalar
models
exhibits
an
infrared
fixed
point
which
is
induced
by
the
degenerate
effective
potential.
The
definition
of
the
correlation
length
in
the
infrared
regime
enables
us
to
determine
the
type
of
the
phase
transition
in
the
model.
It
is
shown
that
the
massive
sine-Gordon
model
exhibits
a
continuous,
while
the
layered
sine-Gordon
model
has
an
infinite
order
Kosterlitz-Thouless
type
phase
transition.
