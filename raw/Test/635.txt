Pairs
Emission
in
a
Uniform
Background
Field:
an
Algebraic
Approach
\\
A
fully
algebraic
general
approach
is
developed
to
treat
the
pairs
emission
and
absorption
in
the
presence
of
some
uniform
external
background
field.
In
particular,
it
is
shown
that
the
pairs
production
and
annihilation
operators,
together
with
the
pairs
number
operator,
do
actually
fulfill
the
SU(2)
functional
Lie
algebra.
As
an
example
of
application,
the
celebrated
Schwinger
formula
is
consistently
and
nicely
recovered,
within
this
novel
approach,
for
a
Dirac
spinor
field
in
the
presence
of
a
constant
and
homogeneous
electric
field
in
four
spacetime
dimensions.
