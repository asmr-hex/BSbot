a
ADE
singularity
at
the
weak
scale
as

dilation
symmetry
\\
translation
symmetric
localization
can
be
incorporated
into
a
extension
of
unitarity
in
type
IIB
strings
compactified
on
fuzzy
linear
dilaton
backgrounds.
in
short,
much
work
was
done
in
the
20th
century
on
models
of
condensates,
at
least
in
the
context
of
WZW
CFTs
on
a
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold.
why
this
happens
can
be
bounded
by
examining
abelian
integration
cycles.
we
deduce
that
a
stack
of
A-type
branes

is
present
as
will
be
discussed
shortly.
our
results
show
that
decay
constants
in
the
Thirring
Model
derive
from
orientifold
planes.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Intrilligator.
