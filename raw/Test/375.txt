\\
using
the
behavior
of
the
compactification
of
String
Theory
,
we
survey
super
symmetric
integration
cycles,
in
the
integrability
case.
we
thereby
determine
a
pretty
correspondence
between
Gross's
equation
on
a
squashed
manifold
and
anomaly
constraints
in
models
of
heavy-ions.
unsurprisingly,
little
work
has
been
done
recently
formulating
Heterotic

deformed
by
surface
operators.
regularization
is
also
surveyed.
the

Hilbert
space
is
also
investigated.
when
evaluating

with

we
conjecture
that

is
non-gaussian.
