Superembedding
methods
for
4d
N-extended
SCFTs
\\
We
consider
the
embedding
method
of
the
superconformal
group
in
four
dimensions
in
the
case
of
extended
supersymmetry,
hence
generalizing
the
recent
work
of
Goldberger,
Skiba
and
Son
which
was
restricted
at
N=1.
Moreover,
we
work
out
explicitly
the
case
of
N=2
chiral
superfields
in
four
dimensions,
putting
the
component
fields
in
correspondence
with
Pascal's
pyramid
at
layer
N.
This
correspondence
is
a
generic
property
of
the
N-extended
chiral
sector.
