Euclidean
Pseudoduality
and
Boundary
Conditions
in
Sigma
Models
\\
We
discuss
pseudoduality
transformations
in
two
dimensional
conformally
invariant
classical
sigma
models,
and
extend
our
analysis
to
a
given
boundaries
of
world-sheet,
which
gives
rise
to
an
appropriate
framework
for
the
discussion
of
the
pseudoduality
between
D-branes.
We
perform
analysis
using
the
Euclidean
spacetime
and
show
that
structures
on
the
target
space
can
be
transformed
into
pseudodual
manifold
identically.
This
map
requires
that
torsions
and
curvatures
related
to
individual
spaces
are
the
same
when
connections
are
riemannian.
Boundary
pseudoduality
imposes
locality
condition.
