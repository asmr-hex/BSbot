in

years,

let
us
explain
cosmic
rays
at
the
GUT
scale.
we
confirm
that
perturbation
theory
is
inflationary.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
cosmic
rays,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
R^m.
a
low-scale
reduction
of

Matrix
Models
dimensionally
reduced
on
n
copies
of
AdS_n
is
nilpotent.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
arresting
principle.
