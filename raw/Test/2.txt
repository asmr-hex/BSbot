\\
partial
progress
was
made
in
recent
years
constructing
Heterotic
string
theory
,
in
the
limit
that
a
extension
of
charges
in
a
n-dimensional
QFT
on
R^m
is
useful
for
understanding
electric-duality
in
supergravity
with
abelian
superpotential
deformed
by

lines.

explain
localization
on
S^n
fibered
over
the
horizon
of
noncommutative
Anti
de

Space
fibered
over
superspace.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
some
general
examples.
after
obtaining
non-abelian
structure,
we
predict
that,
in
the
limit
that
non-abelian
sheaf
cohomology
is
gravitational,
a
analytic
continuation
of
central
charges
in
models
of
entropy
is
inflationary.
