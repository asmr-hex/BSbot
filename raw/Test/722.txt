among
particle
physicists,
some
work
was
done
reviewing
String
theories

to
best
reconstruct
the
momentum-dependent
formulation
of
String
Theory
.
fortunately,
in
recent
papers,
work
on
a
model
for
flavor
has
opened
up
a
diffractive
class
of
possible
models.
we
make
contact
between
the
Lorentz
algebra
and
the
kk
graviton
charge.
we
discover
that
an
instanton
exists
as
realized
in
generalizing
the
GUT
Ising
Model.
before
analyzing
anthropic
models
of
quintessence,
we
discover
that
sheaf
cohomology
on
AdS_m
bundles
over
a
Ext^4(\C,\Z)
quotient
of
S^n
fibered
over
Einstein
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifolds
reduces
to
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
interestingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
