Four
ways
across
the
wall
\\
An
important
question
in
the
study
of
N=2
supersymmetric
string
or
field
theories
is
to
compute
the
jump
of
the
BPS
spectrum
across
walls
of
marginal
stability
in
the
space
of
parameters
or
vacua.
I
survey
four
apparently
different
answers
for
this
problem,
two
of
which
are
based
on
the
mathematics
of
generalized
Donaldson-Thomas
invariants
(the
Kontsevich-Soibelman
and
the
Joyce-Song
formulae),
while
the
other
two
are
based
on
the
physics
of
multi-centered
black
hole
solutions
(the
Coulomb
branch
and
the
Higgs
branch
formulae,
discovered
in
joint
work
with
Jan
Manschot
and
Ashoke
Sen).
Explicit
computations
indicate
that
these
formulae
are
equivalent,
though
a
combinatorial
proof
is
currently
lacking.
