Covariant
Approach
of
the
Dynamics
of
Particles
in
External
Gauge
Fields,
Killing
Tensors
and
Quantum
Gravitational
Anomalies
\\
We
give
an
overview
of
the
first
integrals
of
motion
of
particles
in
the
presence
of
external
gauge
fields
in
a
covariant
Hamiltonian
approach.
The
special
role
of
St\"ackel-Killing
and
Killing-Yano
tensors
is
pointed
out.
Some
nontrivial
examples
involving
Runge-Lenz
type
conserved
quantities
are
explicitly
worked
out.
A
condition
of
the
electromagnetic
field
to
maintain
the
hidden
symmetry
of
the
system
is
stated.
A
concrete
realization
of
this
condition
is
given
by
the
Killing-Maxwell
system
and
exemplified
with
the
Kerr
metric.
Quantum
symmetry
operators
for
the
Klein-Gordon
and
Dirac
equations
are
constructed
from
Killing
tensors.
The
transfer
of
the
classical
conserved
quantities
to
the
quantum
mechanical
level
is
analyzed
in
connection
with
quantum
anomalies.
