M-Brane
Models
and
Loop
Spaces
\\
I
review
an
extension
of
the
ADHMN
construction
of
monopoles
to
M-brane
models.
This
extended
construction
gives
a
map
from
solutions
to
the
Basu-Harvey
equation
to
solutions
to
the
self-dual
string
equation
transgressed
to
loop
space.
Loop
spaces
appear
in
fact
quite
naturally
in
M-brane
models.
This
is
demonstrated
by
translating
a
recently
proposed
M5-brane
model
to
loop
space.
Finally,
I
comment
on
some
recent
developments
related
to
the
loop
space
approach
to
M-brane
models.
