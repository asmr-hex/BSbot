we
prove
a
important
correspondence
between
a
dilation
invariant
solution
of
models
of
pions
and
nontrivial
sheaf
cohomology.
the

of
the

of
symmetric
spaces.
after
extending
some
particular
cases,
we
discover
that
S-duality
in
supersymmetric
QFTs
in
the
presence
of
F_4
singularities
can
be
realized
from
T-duality.
quite
simply,
among
particle
physicists,
Einstein
discovered
that
scalar
branching
ratios
in
type
I
strings
in
the
presence
of
a
noncommutative
brane
probe
are
multidimensional.
we
check
that
a
special
lagrangian
brane
probe
does
not
exist
as
realized
in
models
of
solitons.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
