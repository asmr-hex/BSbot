\\
deriving
hydrodynamics
is
usually
checked
through
the
formulation
of
sheaf
cohomology
in
cosmon
models
of
flavor.
unsurprisingly,
some
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
on
condensate
models
for
condensates.
we
take
a
quantum
gravitational
approach.

our
computation
of
twisted
Matrix
Models
near
a
holomorphic
brane
wrapping
a
AdS_m
provides
renormalization
in
inflatonless
inflation.
while
extending
anomaly
constraints,
we
find
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
T-duality
in
gauge
mediation
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
investigating
deriving
multi-scalar
inflation.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Heisenberg.
