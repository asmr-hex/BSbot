Massless
particles
on
supergroups

supergravity
\\
Firstly,
we
study
the
state
space
of
a
massless
particle
on
a
supergroup
with
a
reparameterization
invariant
action.
After
gauge
fixing
the
reparameterization
invariance,
we
compute
the
physical
state
space
through
the
BRST
cohomology
and
show
that
the
quadratic
Casimir
Hamiltonian
becomes
diagonalizable
in
cohomology.
We
illustrate
the
general
mechanism
in
detail
in
the
example
of
a
supergroup
target
GL(1|1).
The
space
of
physical
states
remains
an
indecomposable
infinite
dimensional
representation
of
the
space-time
supersymmetry
algebra.
Secondly,
we
show
how
the
full
string
BRST
cohomology
in
the
particle
limit
of
string
theory
on
AdS3
x
S3
renders
the
quadratic
Casimir
diagonalizable,
and
reduces
the
Hilbert
space
to
finite
dimensional
representations
of
the
space-time
supersymmetry
algebra
(after
analytic
continuation).
Our
analysis
provides
an
efficient
way
to
calculate
the
Kaluza-Klein
spectrum
for
supergravity
on
AdS3
x
S3.
It
may
also
be
a
step
towards
the
identification
of
an
interesting
and
simpler
subsector
of
logarithmic
supergroup
conformal
field
theories,
relevant
to
string
theory.
