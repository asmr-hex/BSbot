Hyperscaling
violation
:
a
unified
frame
for
effective
holographic
theories
\\
We
investigate
systematic
classifications
of
low
energy
and
lower
dimensional
effective
holographic
theories
with
Lifshitz
and
Schr\"odinger
scaling
symmetries
only
using
metrics
in
terms
of
hyperscaling
violation
($\theta$)
and
dynamical
($z$)
exponents.
Their
consistent
parameter
spaces
are
constrained
by
null
energy
and
positive
specific
heat
conditions,
whose
validity
is
explicitly
checked
against
a
previously
known
result.
From
dimensional
reductions
of
many
microscopic
string
solutions,
we
observe
the
classifications
are
tied
with
the
number
of
scales
in
the
original
microscopic
theories.
Conformal
theories
do
not
generate
a
nontrivial
$\theta$
for
a
simple
sphere
reduction.
Theories
with
Lifshitz
scaling
with
one
scale
are
completely
fixed
by
$\theta$
and
$z$,
and
have
a
universal
emblackening
factor
at
finite
temperature.
Dimensional
reduction
of
intersecting
M2-M5
requires,
we
call,
spatial
anisotropic
exponents
($\sharp$),
along
with
$z$=1,
$\theta$=0,
because
of
another
scale.
Theories
with
Schr\"odinger
scaling
show
similar
simple
classifications
at
zero
temperature,
while
require
more
care
due
to
an
additional
parameter
being
a
thermodynamic
variable
at
finite
temperature.
