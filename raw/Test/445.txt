Non-holomorphic
deformations
of
special
geometry
and
their
applications
\\
The
aim
of
these
lecture
notes
is
to
give
a
pedagogical
introduction
to
the
subject
of
non-holomorphic
deformations
of
special
geometry.
This
subject
was
first
introduced
in
the
context
of
N=2
BPS
black
holes,
but
has
a
wider
range
of
applicability.
