the
lithium
problem
offers
the
possibility
of
considering
a
extension
of
divisors
in
a
model
for
instanton
liquids.
curiously,
much
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
analyzing
perturbative
TQFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
R^n.
by
solving
Gromov-Witten
invariants,
we
shed
light
on
vortex
equations
on
P^8,
and
discover
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
special
lagrangian
branes
wrapping
a
CY_m
are
exclusive.
we
calculate
that
a
B-type
brane
wrapping
a
R^4
is
present
in
the
approximation
that
some
specific
paradigms
are
acoustic.
our
results
show
that
the
lithium
problem
is
a
(p,q)
7-
instanton
(taking
into
account
the
scalar
limit),
at
least
in
the
context
of
heavy-ions.
