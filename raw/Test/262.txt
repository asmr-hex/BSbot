q-deformed
Virasoro-Witt
n-algebra
\\
The
q-deformation
of
the
null
Virasoro-Witt
n-algebra
is
investigated.
We
construct
a
nontrivial
q-deformed
Virasoro-Witt
n-algebra
which
satisfies
the
sh-Jacobi's
identity.
This
q-deformed
infinite-dimensional
n-algebra
is
nothing
but
a
sh-n-Lie
algebra.
For
the
q-deformed
Virasoro-Witt
3-algebra,
we
find
that
there
exists
a
nontrivial
finite-dimensional
sub-3-algebra,
i.e.,
$su_q(1,1)$
3-algebra.
