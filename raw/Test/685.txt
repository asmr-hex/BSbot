Chiral
symmetry
in
$SU(N_c)$
gauge
theories
at
high
density
\\
We
study
$SU(N_c)$
lattice
gauge
theories
with
$N_f$
flavors
of
massless
staggered
fermions
in
the
presence
of
quark
chemical
potential
$\mu$.
A
recent
exact
result
that
in
the
strong
coupling
limit
(vanishing
inverse
gauge
coupling
$\beta$)
and
for
sufficiently
large
$\mu$
the
theory
is
in
a
chiral
symmetric
phase
is
here
extended
into
the
finite
gauge
coupling
region.
A
cluster
expansion
combining
a
fermion
spacelike
hopping
expansion
and
a
strong
coupling
plaquette
expansion
is
shown
to
converge
for
sufficiently
large
$\mu$
and
small
$\beta$
at
any
temperature
$T$.
All
expectations
of
chirally
non-invariant
local
fermion
operators
vanish
identically,
or,
equivalently,
their
correlations
cluster
exponentially
within
the
expansion
implying
absence
of
spontaneous
chiral
symmetry
breaking.
The
resulting
phase
at
low
$T$
may
be
described
as
a
"quarkyonic"
matter
phase.
Some
implications
for
the
phase
diagram
of
$SU(N_c)$
theories
are
discussed.
