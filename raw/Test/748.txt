A
Projection
to
the
Pure
Spinor
Space
\\
This
article
is
based
on
a
talk
given
at
the
Memorial
Conference
for
Maximilian
Kreuzer
at
the
ESI
in
Vienna
and
contains
a
compact
summary
of
a
recent
collaboration
with
P.A.
Grassi.
A
non-linear
projection
from
the
space
of
SO(10)
Weyl
spinors
to
the
space
of
pure
spinors
is
presented
together
with
some
of
its
particular
properties.
This
projection
can
be
used
to
remove
the
constraints
from
Berkovits'
pure
spinor
superstring
while
introducing
additional
gauge
symmetries.
This
should
allow
to
make
transitions
to
equivalent
formulations
which
might
shed
light
on
the
origin
of
the
pure
spinor
ghosts.
It
might
also
be
useful
in
the
context
of
path
integral
measures
for
the
pure
spinor
string.
