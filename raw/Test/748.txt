Scalar
and
electromagnetic
fields
of
static
sources
in
higher
dimensional
Majumdar-Papapetrou
spacetimes
\\
We
study
scalar
massless
and
electromagnetic
fields
from
static
sources
in
a
static
higher
dimensional
spacetime.
Exact
expressions
for
static
Green's
functions
for
such
problems
are
obtained
in
the
background
of
the
Majumdar-Papapetrou
solutions
of
the
Einstein-Maxwell
equations.
Using
this
result
we
calculated
the
force
between
two
scalar
or
electric
charges
in
the
presence
of
one
or
several
extremely
charged
black
holes
in
equilibrium
in
the
higher
dimensional
spacetime.
