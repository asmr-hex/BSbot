Multibrane
solutions
in
cubic
superstring
field
theory
\\
Using
the
elements
of
the
so-called
$KBc\gamma$
subalgebra,
we
study
a
class
of
analytic
solutions
depending
on
a
single
function
$F(K)$
in
the
modified
cubic
superstring
field
theory.
We
compute
the
energy
associated
to
these
solutions
and
show
that
the
result
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
a
contour
integral.
For
a
particular
choice
of
the
function
$F(K)$,
we
show
that
the
energy
is
given
by
integer
multiples
of
a
single
D-brane
tension.
