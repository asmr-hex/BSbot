The
Hirota
equation
for
string
theory
in
AdS5xS5
from
the
fusion
of
line
operators
\\
We
present
a
perturbative
derivation
of
the
T-system
that
is
believed
to
encode
the
exact
spectrum
of
planar
N=4
SYM.
The
T-system
is
understood
as
an
operator
identity
between
some
special
line
operators,
the
quantum
transfer
matrices.
By
computing
the
quantum
corrections
in
the
process
of
fusion
of
transfer
matrices,
we
show
that
the
T-system
holds
up
to
first
order
in
a
semi-classical
expansion.
This
derivation
does
not
rely
on
any
assumption.
We
also
discuss
the
extension
of
the
proof
to
other
theories,
including
models
describing
string
theory
on
various
AdS
spaces.
