Low
temperature
properties
of
holographic
condensates
\\
In
the
current
work
we
study
various
models
of
holographic
superconductors
at
low
temperature.
Generically
the
zero
temperature
limit
of
those
models
are
solitonic
solution
with
a
zero
sized
horizon.
Here
we
generalized
simple
version
of
those
zero
temperature
solutions
to
small
but
non-zero
temperature
T.
We
confine
ourselves
to
cases
where
near
horizon
geometry
is
AdS^4.
At
a
non-zero
temperature
a
small
horizon
would
form
deep
inside
this
AdS^4
which
does
not
disturb
the
UV
physics.
The
resulting
geometry
may
be
matched
with
the
zero
temperature
solution
at
an
intermediate
length
scale.
We
understand
this
matching
from
separation
of
scales
by
setting
up
a
perturbative
expansion
in
gauge
potential.
We
have
a
better
analytic
control
in
abelian
case
and
quantities
may
be
expressed
in
terms
of
hypergeometric
function.
From
this
we
calculate
low
temperature
behavior
of
various
quatities
like
entropy,
charge
density
and
specific
heat
etc.
We
also
calculate
various
energy
gaps
associated
with
p-wave
holographic
superconductor
to
understand
the
underlying
pairing
mechanism.
The
result
deviates
significantly
from
the
corresponding
weak
coupling
BCS
counterpart.
