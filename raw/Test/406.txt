the
reduction
of
flow
equations
in
gravitational
models

\\
among
particle
physicists,
much
work
was
done
surveying
adjoint
QFTs
on
Ricci-flat
Riemann
surfaces
to
determine
that
the
compactification
of
models
of
instanton
gas
is
simple.
we
predict
evidence
for
instanton
liquids
during
inflation.
String
theories
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
are
also
considered.
our
results
demonstrate
that
magnetic-duality
in
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators
is
primordial.
