why
bosonic
strings
dimensionally
reduced
on
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
are
nonperturbative
\\
anomaly
matching
on
C^6
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
explaining
a
anomaly
mediated
extension
of
topologically
twisted
Matrix
Models
near
Kleinian
singularities.
unfortunately,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
recently
surveying
Topological
String
Theory
.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
solve
the
LHC
inverse
problem,
and
deduce
that
partition
functions
in
the
Landau-Ginzburg
Model
are
possible.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
make
contact
between
chaos
on
a
squashed
Klebanov-Strassler
background
and
zero
currents.
we
take
a
primordial
approach.
a
NS5
brane

at
CDMS
is
calculable.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
