Boundary
Super-Deformations,
Boundary
States,
and
Tachyon
Condensation
\\
The
open
string
tachyon
and
U(1)
gauge
field
as
longitudinal
fluctuations
and
the
velocity
as
transverse
fluctuation
of
an
arbitrary
dimensional
D-brane
are
considered
as
boundary
deformations
of
a
closed
superstring
free
action.
The
path
integral
approach
will
be
applied
to
calculate
the
corresponding
generalized
boundary
states
using
supersymmetrized
boundary
actions.
Obtaining
the
disk
partition
functions
from
the
boundary
states
and
studying
the
effect
of
tachyon
condensation
on
both
of
them
in
the
NSNS
and
RR
sectors,
leads
to
results
that
differ
from
the
established
ones.
