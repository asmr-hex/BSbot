Open
Verlinde
line
operators
\\
We
reformulate
the
action
of
Verlinde
line
operators
on
conformal
blocks
in
a
3d
TFT
language
and
extend
it
to
line
operators
labelled
by
open
paths
joining
punctures
on
the
Riemann
surface.
We
discuss
the
possible
applications
of
open
Verlinde
line
operators
to
quantum
Teichm\"uller
theory,
supersymmetric
gauge
theory
and
quantum
groups
