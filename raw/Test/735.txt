Seven-Dimensional
Super-Yang-Mills
Theory
in
N=1
Superfields
\\
We
give
a
gauge-covariant
formulation
of
seven-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills
theory
in
terms
of
N=1
superfields.
Furthermore,
we
show
that
five
and
seven
dimensions
are
the
only
cases
where
such
a
formulation
exists
by
analysing
the
interplay
of
Lorentz
and
R
symmetries.
The
action
is
expressed
in
terms
of
field
strengths
and
a
Chern--Simons-like
superpotential.
Each
term
is
manifestly
N=1
supersymmetric,
Lorentz
invariant
in
four
dimensions
and
gauge
invariant
under
superfield
gauge
transformations,
including
those
that
do
not
preserve
Wess--Zumino
gauge.
