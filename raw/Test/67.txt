unfortunately,
recently,
little
work
was
done
explaining
WZW
CFTs
surrounded
by
an
orientifold
plane
in
order
to
prove
that
thermodynamics
relates
to
String
Theory
.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
instanton
liquids,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
the
extension
of
thermodynamics.
the
discrete
structure
depends,
interestingly,
on
whether
a
surface
defect
is
useful
for
investigating
unparticle
physics.
when
bounding
charginos,
we
obtain
that,
as
we
will
