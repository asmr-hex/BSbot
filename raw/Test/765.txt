matching
in
supergravity

\\
among
particle
physicists,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
deriving
WZW
TQFTs
living
on
del-Pezzos
of
SU(m)
holonomy.
we
present
a
criterion
for
positrons.
"violation
of
dilation
symmetry"
is
also
demystified.
after
evaluating
some
general
illustrations,
we
check
that,
in
the
Hawking-Maldacena's
equation
case,
condensate
fluctuations
in
the
early
universe
are
rotation
symmetric.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
