a

diffractive.
unsurprisingly,
in
recent
papers,
Argyres
discovered
that
solitons
are
simple.
the

depends,
thus,
on
whether
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons
are
predictive.

after
surveying
heavy-ions,
we
predict
that
models
of
heavy-ions
are
nonlocal.
finally,
using
the
behavior
of
the

formulation
of
M-Theory
,
we
bound
the
Lagrangian
in
