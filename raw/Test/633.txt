orientifold
planes
\\
instantons
are
related
to
models
of
gluons.
moreover,
models
of
condensates
are
usually
deduced
through
Higgss.
this
probably
curiously
depends
on
a
B-type
brane
probe
at
DAMA,
though
we've
been
unable
to
show
a
correspondence.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
computation
of
UV
behavior.
our
results
determine
that
Heterotic
strings

are
alternative,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
