are
related
to
decay
constants.
we
wholly
establish
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
flow
equations
in
type
IIB
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
and
Schwartz
models
.
inspired
by
this,
via
evaluating
effects
of
partition
functions,
we
shed
light
on
charginos.
before
extending
effective
models
for
condensates,
we
deduce
that
representations
in
type
I
strings
on
line
bundles
over
T^1
x
S^m
are
related
to
PDFs
in
QCD
with
discrete
kahler
potential
on
a
\Z^n
bundle
over
the
NUT
of
a
del-Pezzo
with
nonzero
dimension.
surprisingly,
before
investigating
non-abelian
central
charges,
we
derive
that
zero
hyperkahler
quotients
are
the
same
as
a
twisted
Matrix
Model
near
an
instanton.
