Predictions
of
a
fundamental
statistical
picture
\\
A
picture
is
presented
in
which
standard
physics
and
its
extensions
are
obtained
from
statistical
counting
and
stochastic
fluctuations,
together
with
the
geography
of
our
particular
universe
in
D
dimensions.
The
inescapable
predictions
include
supersymmetry,
SO(d)
grand
unification,
Higgs-like
bosons,
vanishing
of
the
usual
cosmological
constant,
nonstandard
behavior
of
scalar
bosons,
and
Lorentz
violation
at
extremely
high
energies.
