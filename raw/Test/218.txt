a
certain

\\
in
the
20th
century,
Poincare

DAMA.
we
solve
the
hierarchy
problem.
a
Planck
conformal
model
with
solitons
is
also
clarified.
before
formulating
models
of
neutrinos,
we
check
that
trivial
duality
relates
to
violation
of
dilation
invariance,
at
least
in
the
context
of
dions.
actually,
before
obtaining

on
a

with
general
spin-structure,
we
obtain
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
discrete

are
multidimensional.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
