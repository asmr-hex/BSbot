sun
\\
much
work
was
done
in
the
20th
century
on
the
Stueckelberg
Model.
quite
simply,
recently,
work
on
models
of
solitons
has
opened
up
a
nonstandard
class
of
lattice
models.
we
show
a
pretty
correspondence
between
super
symmetric
duality
and
symplectic
quotients
on
T^9,
and
derive
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Verlinde-Glashow,
bubble
nucleation
at
the
LHC
in
short
is
the
final
component
in
bounding
U-duality
in
technicolor,
in
the
limit
that
black
instantons
can
be
incorporated
into
T-dualities
in
topologically
twisted
CFTs
deformed
by
primary
operators.
fortunately,
unitarity
in
WZW
CFTs

can
be
discovered
from
our
dimensionality.
while
extending
a
magnetic-dual
of
exactly-soluble
models
for
cosmic
rays,
we
check
that,
by
super
symmetry,
E_6
singularities
are
equivalent
to
the
magnetic-dual
of
type
IIB
on
G_2
orbifolds
of
CY_7
bundles
over
RS1
backgrounds
of
Dih_6
holonomy.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
