Compressible
Matter
at
a
Holographic
Interface
\\
We
study
the
interface
between
a
fractional
topological
insulator
and
an
ordinary
insulator,
both
described
using
holography.
By
turning
on
a
chemical
potential
we
induce
a
finite
density
of
matter
localized
at
the
interface.
These
are
gapless
surface
excitations
which
are
expected
to
have
a
fermionic
character.
We
study
the
thermodynamics
of
the
system,
finding
a
symmetry
preserving
compressible
state
at
low
temperatures,
whose
excitations
exhibit
hyperscaling
violation.
These
results
are
consistent
with
the
expectation
of
gapless
fermionic
excitations
forming
a
Fermi
surface
at
finite
density.
