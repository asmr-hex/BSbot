T-duality

\\
among
mathematicians,
Georgi
predicted
that
a
warped
extension
of
models
of
dark
energy
depends
on
the
analytic
continuation
of
large
field
inflation.
we
discover
evidence
for
exploring
m-dimensional
unparticle
physics
far
from
a
stack
of
fractional
D3
branes
wrapping
a
R^6.
the
B-model/anomaly
mediation
correspondence
led
us
to
a
ingenious
rule:
conformal
blocks
on
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
are
asymmetric.
cosmic
rays
at
the
LHC
are
related
to
models
of
dark
matter.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
surprising
rule.
