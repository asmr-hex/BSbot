We
use
gauge/gravity
duality
to
explore
strongly
coupled
superconductors
with
dynamical
exponent
$z=2$.
In
the
probe
limit
we
numerically
establish
background
solutions
for
the
matter
fields
and
plot
the
condensate
versus
the
dimensionless
temperature.
We
then
investigate
electromagnetic
perturbations
in
order
to
compute
the
AC
conductivity
and
also
calculate
the
spectral
function.
Our
results
for
the
condensate
and
conductivity
are
qualitatively
similar
to
those
of
the
AdS
superconductor.
However,
we
find
that
(for
both
s-
and
p-wave)
the
condensate
does
not
approach
a
constant
at
very
low
temperature
and
the
conductivity
goes
to
one
from
below
but
never
exceeds
it
in
the
high
frequency
limit,
in
contrast
to
the
AdS
black
hole.
We
do
not
see
a
peak
at
nonzero
frequency
in
the
imaginary
part
of
the
AC
conductivity
along
the
$x$
direction
for
the
p-wave
case.
These
features
are
due
to
the
nontrivial
dynamical
exponent.
To
be
specific,
the
black
hole
geometry
considered
in
this
work
is
anisotropic
between
space
and
time,
very
different
from
the
Schwarzschild-AdS
black
hole,
which
results
in
different
asymptotic
behaviors
of
temporal
and
spatial
components
of
gauge
fields
than
those
in
the
Schwarzschild-AdS
black
hole.
