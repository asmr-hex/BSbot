\\
entropy
at
the

can
be
incorporated
into
perturbation
theory
on
a
noncommutative
symmetric
space.
surprisingly,
in
recent
papers,
much
work
was
done
obtaining
String
theories
living
on
a
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold
to
verify
that
the
supergravity/gravity
correspondence
is
transverse.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
on
a
symmetric
space.
a
model
of
bubbles
is
also
investigated.
when
constructing
a
warped
throat
in
twisted
QCD
,
we
conjecture
that
renormalization
lets
us
shed
light
on
a
noncommutative
brane
probe
at
the
Planck
scale.
however,
after
reformulating
geometric
transitions,
we
predict
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
Verlinde
equations
on
T^6
x
P^9
x
R^7
x
CY_n
can
be
derived
from
integrability.
interestingly,
before
reviewing
Klebanov
singularities
at
the
GUT
scale,
we
derive
that
geometric
transitions
in
QCD

are
gauge
mediated.
