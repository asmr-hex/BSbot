Dark
Energy
in
Modified
Supergravity
\\
We
propose
a
supersymmetric
extension
of
the
dynamical
dark
energy
function
and
the
corresponding
scalar
(super)potential
in
F(R)
supergravity.
Our
model
is
viable
in
the
Einstein
approximation,
and
also
has
an
analytic
(regular)
Wess-Zumino-type
scalar
superpotential.
The
hidden
sector
responsible
for
spontaneous
supersymmetry
breaking
is
given.
