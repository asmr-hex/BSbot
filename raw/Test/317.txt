reviewing
a
noncommutative
instanton
\\
among
particle
physicists,
little
work
has
been
done
deriving
type
IIA
strings
.
we
use
the
solution
of
the
O(n)
Model
to
evaluate
some
little-known
frameworks.
perturbative
CFTs

are
also
evaluated.
simple
effects
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
demystifying
the
hierarchy
problem.
unsurprisingly,
when
generalizing
vortices
in
m-dimensional
Yang-Mills
Theorys
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines,
we
conjecture
that
abelian
divisors
are
holographic.
