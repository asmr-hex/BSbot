The
conjectured
holographic
duality
between
vector
models
with
quartic
interaction
and
higher-spin
field
theory
in
the
bulk
is
reviewed,
with
emphasis
on
some
versions
and
generalisations
(higher
dimensions,
beyond
the
singlet
sector,
etc)
which
have
not
been
much
investigated
yet.
The
strongest
form
of
the
conjecture
assumes
that
it
holds
for
any
(not
necessarily
large)
number
of
massless
scalar
fields
and
for
any
value
of
the
coupling
constant.
Since
the
quartic
interaction
is
of
double-trace
type,
the
exact
duality
(for
any
value
of
the
coupling
constant)
automatically
follows
from
its
validity
at
the
Gaussian
fixed
point
(for
vanishing
coupling
constant).
The
validity
of
the
latter
also
implies
that
unbroken
higher
spin
symmetries
should
prevent
quantum
corrections
in
the
bulk.
