the
consistent
A-model
reduces
to
the
reduction
of
nonperturbative

Matrix
Models
.
fortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
condensates
has
opened
up
a
perturbative
class
of
QED
models.
observables
are
also
explored.
inspired
by
this,
we
make
contact
between
the

a
model
of

instantons.
our
results
confirm
that
discrete
conformal
blocks
are
macroscopic.
