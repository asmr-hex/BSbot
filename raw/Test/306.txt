Batalin-Vilkovisky
action
of
Chern-Simons
theory
in
superspace
\\
We
discuss
the
extended
BRST
and
anti-BRST
symmetry
(including
shift
symmetry)
in
the
Batalin-Vilkovisky
(BV)
formulation
for
the
Chern-Simons
(CS)
theories
in
(2
+
1)
spacetime
di-
mensions.
Further
we
develop
the
superspace
description
of
these
theories
in
BV
formulation.
We
show
that
the
extended
BRST
invariant
action
for
these
theories
can
be
written
manifestly
covari-
ant
manner
in
a
superspace
with
one
Grassmann
coordinate.
On
the
hand
a
superspace
with
two
Grassmann
coordinates
are
required
for
a
manifestly
covariant
formulation
of
the
extended
BRST
and
extended
anti-BRST
invariant
actions
for
CS
theories.
