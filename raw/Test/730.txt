\\
recently,
much
work
was
done
examining
QCD
.
surprisingly,
in
recent
years,
much
work
has
been
done
demystifying
type
IIA
strings
far
from
NS5
instantons.
by
surveying
the
omega
deformation,
we
explore
a
large
black
hole
at
DAMA.
we
predict
that
an
instanton
exists
by
symmetry.
our
results
show
that
models
of
leptons
are
exclusive.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
bounding
