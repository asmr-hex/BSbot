The
covariance
of
multi-field
perturbations,
pseudo-susy
and
f_NL
\\
We
reconsider
cosmological
perturbation
theory
for
multi-component
scalars,
enforcing
covariance
in
field-space,
and
ensuring
that
phyical
observations
are
independent
of
field
re-definitions.
We
use
the
formalism
to
clarify
some
issues
in
the
literature,
and
use
pseudo-supersymmetry
to
derive
exact
expressions
for
terms
of
interest.
