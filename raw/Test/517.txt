Six-loop
Konishi
anomalous
dimension
from
the
Y-system
\\
We
compute
the
Konishi
anomalous
dimension
perturbatively
up
to
six
loop
using
the
finite
set
of
functional
equations
derived
recently
by
Gromov,
Kazakov,
Leurent
and
Volin.
The
recursive
procedure
can
be
in
principle
extended
to
higher
loops,
the
only
obstacle
being
the
complexity
of
the
computation.
