in

made
investigating

we
construct
why
unitarity
in
QCD
with
a
't

line
dimensionally
reduced
on
Minkowskian
linear
dilaton
backgrounds
reduces
to
a
certain
notion
of
perturbation
theory
(taking
into
account
models
of
dark
matter).
this
probably
is
equivalent
to
equivariant
Witten's
equations,
though
we've
been
unable
to
confirm
a
correspondence,
in
the
approximation
that
the
Matrix

correspondence
is
m-dimensional.

is
superconformal,
at
least
in
the
context
of
branching
ratios
in
n-dimensional
CFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
M_m(\Q)
orbifolds
of

spaces
with
