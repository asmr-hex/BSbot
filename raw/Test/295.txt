Super
Yang-Mills
Theory
with
Impurity
Walls
and
Instanton
Moduli
Spaces
\\
We
explore
maximally
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
theory
with
walls
of
impurities
respecting
half
of
the
supersymmetries.
The
walls
carry
fundamental
or
bifundamental
matter
multiplets.
We
employ
three-dimensional
N=2
superspace
language
to
identify
the
Higgs
branch
of
this
theory.
We
find
that
the
vacuum
conditions
determining
the
Higgs
branch
are
exactly
the
bow
equations
yielding
Yang-Mills
instantons
on
a
multi-Taub-NUT
space.
