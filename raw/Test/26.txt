Losing
information
outside
the
horizon
\\
Suppose
we
allow
a
system
to
fall
freely
from
infinity
to
a
point
near
(but
not
beyond)
the
horizon
of
a
black
hole.
We
note
that
in
a
sense
the
information
in
the
system
is
already
lost
to
an
observer
at
infinity.
Once
the
system
is
too
close
to
the
horizon
it
does
not
have
enough
energy
to
send
its
information
back
because
the
information
carrying
quanta
would
get
redshifted
to
a
point
where
they
get
confused
with
Hawking
radiation.
If
one
attempts
to
turn
the
infalling
system
around
and
bring
it
back
to
infinity
for
observation
then
it
will
experience
Unruh
radiation
from
the
required
acceleration.
This
radiation
can
excite
the
bits
in
the
system
carrying
the
information,
thus
reducing
the
fidelity
of
this
information.
We
find
the
radius
where
the
information
is
essentially
lost
in
this
way,
noting
that
this
radius
depends
on
the
energy
gap
(and
coupling)
of
the
system.
We
look
for
some
universality
by
using
the
highly
degenerate
BPS
ground
states
of
a
quantum
gravity
theory
(string
theory)
as
our
information
storage
device.
For
such
systems
one
finds
that
the
critical
distance
to
the
horizon
set
by
Unruh
radiation
is
the
geometric
mean
of
the
black
hole
radius
and
the
radius
of
the
extremal
hole
with
quantum
numbers
of
the
BPS
bound
state.
Overall,
the
results
suggest
that
information
in
gravity
theories
should
be
regarded
not
as
a
quantity
contained
in
a
system,
but
in
terms
of
how
much
of
this
information
is
accessible
to
another
observer.
