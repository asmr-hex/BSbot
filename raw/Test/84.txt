Evidence
for
a
family
of
SO(8)
gauged
supergravity
theories
\\
In
this
note
we
discuss
the
classification
of
duality
orbits
of
N
=
8
gauged
supergravity
models.
Using
tensor
classifiers,
we
show
that
there
is
a
one-parameter
family
of
inequivalent
SO(8)
gauged
supergravity
theories.
We
briefly
discuss
the
couplings
of
such
models
and
show
that,
although
the
maximally
symmetric
vacuum
has
the
same
quadratic
spectrum,
the
supersymmetry
transformations,
the
couplings
and
the
scalar
potential
are
parameter
dependent.
We
also
comment
on
the
possible
M-theory
uplift
and
on
the
meaning
of
the
parameter
for
the
dual
gauge
theories.
