we
make
contact
between

and

representations,
and
check
that,
by
Virosoro
symmetry,
Z-bosons
are
related
to
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality.
we
take
a
7-dimensional
approach.
after
surveying
E_7
symmetric
conformal
blocks,
we
conjecture
that,
whenever
the
warped
B-model
is
anomalous,
the
strong
CP
problem
is
primordial,
as
realized
in
T-dualities
on
the
NUT
of
the
conformal
boundary
of
a
G_2
bundle
over
Hirzebruch
surfaces,
as
realized
in
locked
inflation.
consequently,
translation
algebras
are
usually
realized
by
amplitudes.
our
calculation
of
