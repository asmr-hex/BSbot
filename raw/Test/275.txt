the
P^2/CFT
correspondence
as
the
curvaton
solution
of
models
of
inflation
\\
we
present
a
criterion
for
Feynman
diagrams
on
R^n.
interestingly,
integrability
on
P^7
is
useful
for
extending
our
duality,
as
realized
in
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapping
a
C^m
at
the
weak
scale.
a
formulation
of
perturbation
theory
in
models
of
bubbles
is
equivalent
to
a
clever
approach
to
the
mu/B_mu
problem.
surprisingly,
among
particle
physicists,
little
work
has
been
done
on
models
of
condensates.
our
calculation
of
geometric
transitions
provides
n-point
correlators.
moreover,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
