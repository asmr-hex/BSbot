on
electron
collisions
\\
we
solve
the
fine-tuning
problem,
as
realized
in
cosmic
rays
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$,
completely
generalizing
that
a
boundary
resolution
of
the
LHC
inverse
problem
is
impossible.
the
Hamiltonian
is
also
classified.
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
is
spontaneous.
in
short,
among
mathematicians,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
models
of
inflation.
we
also
check
agreement
with
a
hypersurface
defect
at
SNO.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
analyzing
Feynman
diagrams
on
Sp(m)
bundles
over
AdS_n.
