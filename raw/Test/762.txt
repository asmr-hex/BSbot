Recent
developments
in
non-Abelian
T-duality
in
string
theory
\\
We
briefly
review
the
essential
points
of
our
recent
work
in
non-Abelian
T-duality.
In
particular,
we
show
how
non-abelian
T-duals
can
effectively
describe
infinitely
high
spin
sectors
of
a
parent
theory
and
how
to
implement
the
transformation
in
the
presence
of
non-vanishing
Ramond
fields
in
type-II
supergravity.
