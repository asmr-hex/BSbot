the
acoustic
parent
compactification
of
Topological
String
Theory
dimensionally
reduced
on
T^m
\\
supergravity
deformed
by
quasi-primary
operators
is
usually
checked
from
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology.
inspired
by
this,
we
make
contact
between
surface
defects
and
anomaly
matching.
unfortunately,
in
recent
years,
much
work
was
done
discussing
a
Toda
TQFT
.
we
use
W-boson
collisions
in
F-Theory
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
to
explore
the
3PI
effective
action,
and
evaluate
instantons,
in
the
sheaf
cohomology
case.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
superdiffeomorphism
symmetric
sheaf
cohomology.
our
results
confirm
that
abelian
index
theorems
are
anomalous.
