New
Variables
For
Graviton
Scattering
Amplitudes
\\
Motivated
by
the
success
of
Hodges'
momentum
twistor
variables
in
planar
Yang-Mills,
in
this
note
we
introduce
a
set
of
new
variables,
the
S
variables,
which
are
tailored
for
gravity
(or
more
generally
for
theories
without
color
ordering).
The
S
variables
trivialize
all
on-shell
constraints
on
kinematic
data
and
momentum
conservation
while
keeping
permutation
invariance.
We
explicitly
show
the
relation
between
the
S
variables
and
the
spinor-helicity
variables
as
well
as
the
connection
to
momentum
twistors.
The
S
variables
can
be
nicely
understood
using
the
geometry
of
Grassmannians
and
are
determined
by
a
2-plane
and
a
4-plane
in
C^n,
with
n
the
number
of
the
particles.
As
an
illustration
of
their
utility,
we
use
the
S
variables
to
present
a
reference-free
form
of
soft
factors
and
tree
level
MHV
amplitudes
of
gravity
which
is
obtained
by
using
the
recent
formula
given
by
Hodges.
