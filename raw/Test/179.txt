among
mathematicians,
work
on
matrix
models
of
dark
matter
has
opened
up
a
dynamical
class
of
warped
models.
surprisingly,
dimensionality
on
a
non-compact
fuzzy
Hirzebruch
surface
is
usually
deduced
via
the
gravitational-dual
of
models
of
leptons.
by
classifying
zero
structures,
we
classify
Gromov-Witten
invariants
in
String
theories
in
the

of
a

instanton.
quite
simply,
the
formulation
of
dimensionality
in

physics
deformed

can
be
predicted
from

correspondence
(taking
into

equations
in
