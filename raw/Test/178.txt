Scaling
dimensions
at
small
spin
in
N=4
SYM
theory
\\
In
this
paper,
we
examine
scaling
dimensions
at
small
spin
in
the
so-called
sl(2)
sector
of
the
planar
maximally
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
theory.
We
find
that
the
Bethe
ansatz
equations,
which
control
the
spectrum
of
scaling
dimensions,
greatly
simplify
in
this
limit
and
can
be
solved
exactly.
