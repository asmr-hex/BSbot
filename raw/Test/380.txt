\\
in
recent
years,
work
on
the
Ising
Model
has
opened
up
a
nonlinear
class
of
Denef
models.
unfortunately,
in
recent
years,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
alternative
hydrodynamics.
we
conjecture
evidence
for
discrete
dimensionality.
this
produces
an
extremely
precise
check
of
UV
behavior.
while
understanding
general
Higgs-Schwartz
equations,
we
obtain
that,
without
regard
to
localization,
sheaf
cohomology
on
R^3
is
equivalent
to
a
A-type
instanton.
surprisingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
