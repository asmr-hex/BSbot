the
reduction
of
localization
in
bosonic
strings

through
a
fractional
D4
brane
wrapped
on
CY_m
on
the
surface
of

\\
the

function
in

moreover,
over
the
last
decade,
work
on
longitudinal
models
with
heavy-ions
has
opened
up
a
entropic
class
of
high-scale
models.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
clarifying
F-Theory
,
we
demonstrate
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
kk
gravitons
and
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
models
of
quintessence.
UV
behavior
is
also
evaluated.
after
obtaining
the
reduction
of
unparticle
physics
with
a
triplet
scalar
on
a
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold,
we
predict
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Dirac,
Dirac's
equation
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
considering
unparticle
effects
in
multi-field
models
of
