Dressing
cosets
revisited
\\
We
present
an
alternative
algebraic
derivation
of
the
dual
pair
of
nonlinear
$\sigma$-models
based
on
the
'dressing
cosets'
extension
of
the
Poisson-Lie
$T$-duality
\cite{KS1}.
Then
we
generalize
the
result
to
dual
pairs
of
Lagrangians
not
considered
in
\cite{KS1}.
Our
generalization
turns
out
to
incorporate
the
dualisable
models
constructed
by
Sfetsos
in
\cite{Sfet1}.
