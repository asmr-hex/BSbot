The
Large
N
't
Hooft
Limit
of
Kazama-Suzuki
Model
\\
We
consider
N=2
Kazama-Suzuki
model
on
CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)xU(1).
It
is
known
that
the
N=2
current
algebra
for
the
supersymmetric
WZW
model,
at
level
k,
is
a
nonlinear
algebra.
The
N=2
W_3
algebra
corresponding
to
N=2
was
recovered
from
the
generalized
GKO
coset
construction
previously.
For
N=4,
we
construct
one
of
the
higher
spin
currents,
in
N=2
W_5
algebra,
with
spins
(2,
5/2,
5/2,
3).
The
self-coupling
constant
in
the
operator
product
expansion
of
this
current
and
itself
depends
on
N
as
well
as
k
explicitly.
We
also
observe
a
new
higher
spin
primary
current
of
spins
(3,
7/2,
7/2,
4).
From
the
behaviors
of
N=2,
4
cases,
we
expect
the
operator
product
expansion
of
the
lowest
higher
spin
current
and
itself
in
N=2
W_{N+1}
algebra.
By
taking
the
large
(N,
k)
limit
on
the
various
operator
product
expansions
in
components,
we
reproduce,
at
the
linear
order,
the
corresponding
operator
product
expansions
in
N=2
classical
W_{\infty}^{cl}[\lambda]
algebra
which
is
the
asymptotic
symmetry
of
the
higher
spin
AdS_3
supergravity
found
recently.
