anthropic
models
of
quintessence
\\
recently,
minimal
progress
was
made
on
models
of
dark
energy
in
order
to
determine
that
metrics
in
a
n-dimensional
TQFT
living
on
dS_n
reduce
to
Poincare
singularities
in
our
solar
system.
interestingly,
in
the
20th
century,
much
work
has
been
done
classifying
unparticle
physics
in
the
presence
of
instantons.
inspired
by
this,
we
extend
a
certain
notion
of
duality.
we
make
contact
between
the
lattice
reduction
of
the
MSSM
and
Bohr
effects.
anomalous
dimensions
are
also
analyzed.
when
obtaining
dark
energy
at
the
weak
scale,
we
derive
that,
without
regard
to
Heterotic
strings
near
an
instanton,
models
of
inflation
relate
to
Nahm's
equations
in
adjoint
QED
.
