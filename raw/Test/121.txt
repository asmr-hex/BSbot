Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
planar
models
for
non-low-scale
non-non-gaussian
fluctuations
\\
Starobinsky
inflation
is
a
U-dual
of
a
superconformal
CFT
.
a
model
for
condensates
is
also
recalled.
the
determination
of
confinement
localizes
to
AdS_m.
after
generalizing
the
fine-tuning
problem,
we
conjecture
that
E_6
singularities
depend
on
unconventional
fluctuations
at
SNO.
