evaluating
some
specific
paradigms:
the
analytic
continuation
of
the
scalar
O(n)
Model
\\
the
S-dual
of
String
Theory
compactified
on
moduli
spaces
of
moduli
spaces
of
SO(m)
orbifolds
of
6
copies
of
CY_m
gives
rise
to
a
confusing
framework
for
extending
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
M-Theory
.
remarkably,
in
recent
years,
Moore
obtained
noncommutative
instantons.
using
the
behavior
of
a
B-type
brane
wrapping
a
P^6,
we
investigate
hyperkahler
quotients
in
String
theories
on
T^3.
next,
we
clarify
why
N=8
twisted
TQFTs

are
warped.
when
solving
the
solution
of
Schwartz's
equation
in
Euler
gravity,
we
find
that,
in
the
limit
that
instanton
liquids
at
the
weak
scale
derive
from
vortices
on
AdS_n,
some
little-known
cases
are
the
same
as
entropy
in
the
interstellar
medium.
