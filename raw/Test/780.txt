Hyperscaling
violation
from
supergravity
\\
In
recent
applications
of
AdS/CFT
to
condensed
matter
physics,
a
metric
that
transforms
covariantly
under
dilatation
has
been
argued
to
signal
hyperscaling
violation
in
a
dual
quantum
field
theory.
We
contextualize
and
introduce
large,
in
some
cases
infinite,
families
of
supergravity
solutions
with
this
property,
focusing
on
scale
covariant
generalizations
of
AdS
and
Schrodinger
spacetimes.
These
embeddings
rely
on
various
aspects
of
dimensional
reduction
and
flux
compactification
of
eleven-dimensional
supergravity.
Our
top-down
approach
can
be
viewed
as
a
partial
holographic
classification
of
the
landscape
of
strongly
coupled,
UV
complete
quantum
field
theories
with
hyperscaling
violation.
