SYM
integrand
\\
Recently,
a
recursion
relation
has
been
developed,
generating
the
four-dimensional
integrand
of
the
amplitudes
of
N=4
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
theory
for
any
number
of
loops
and
legs.
In
this
paper,
I
provide
a
comparison
of
the
prediction
for
the
two-loop
six-point
maximally
helicity-violating
(MHV)
integrand
against
the
result
obtained
by
use
of
the
leading
singularity
method.
The
comparison
is
performed
numerically
for
a
large
number
of
randomly
selected
momenta
and
in
all
cases
finds
agreement
between
the
two
results
to
high
numerical
accuracy.
