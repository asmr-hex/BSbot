Loops,
Polytopes
and
Splines
\\
We
uncover
an
unexpected
connection
between
the
physics
of
loop
integrals
and
the
mathematics
of
spline
functions.
One
loop
integrands
are
Laplace
transforms
of
splines.
This
clarifies
the
geometry
of
the
associated
loop
integrals,
since
a
$n$-node
spline
has
support
on
an
$n$-vertex
polyhedral
cone.
One-loop
integrals
are
integrals
of
splines
on
a
hyperbolic
slice
of
the
cone,
yielding
polytopes
in
$AdS$
space.
Splines
thus
give
a
geometrical
counterpart
to
the
rational
function
identities
at
the
level
of
the
integrand.
Spline
technology
also
allows
for
a
clear,
simple,
algebraic
decomposition
of
higher
point
loop
integrals
in
lower
dimensional
kinematics
in
terms
of
lower
point
integrals
-
e.g.
an
hexagon
integral
in
2d
kinematics
can
be
written
as
a
sum
of
scalar
boxes.
Higher
loops
can
also
be
understood
directly
in
terms
of
splines
-
they
map
onto
spline
convolutions,
leading
to
an
intriguing
representation
in
terms
of
hyperbolic
simplices
integrated
over
other
hyperbolic
simplices.
We
finish
with
speculations
on
the
interpretation
of
one-loop
integrals
as
partition
functions,
inspired
by
the
use
of
splines
in
counting
points
in
polytopes.
