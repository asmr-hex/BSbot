Observables
in
the
General
Boundary
Formulation
\\
We
develop
a
notion
of
quantum
observable
for
the
general
boundary
formulation
of
quantum
theory.
This
notion
is
adapted
to
spacetime
regions
rather
than
to
hypersurfaces
and
naturally
fits
into
the
topological
quantum
field
theory
like
axiomatic
structure
of
the
general
boundary
formulation.
We
also
provide
a
proposal
for
a
generalized
concept
of
expectation
value
adapted
to
this
type
of
observable.
We
show
how
the
standard
notion
of
quantum
observable
arises
as
a
special
case
together
with
the
usual
expectation
values.
We
proceed
to
introduce
various
quantization
schemes
to
obtain
such
quantum
observables
including
path
integral
quantization
(yielding
the
time-ordered
product),
Berezin-Toeplitz
(antinormal
ordered)
quantization
and
normal
ordered
quantization,
and
discuss
some
of
their
properties.
