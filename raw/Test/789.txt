Resolving
anti-brane
singularities
through
time-dependence
\\
In
this
note
we
discuss
a
possible
resolution
of
the
flux
singularities
associated
with
the
insertion
of
branes
in
backgrounds
supported
by
fluxes
that
carry
charges
opposite
to
the
branes.
We
present
qualitative
arguments
that
such
a
setup
could
be
unstable
both
in
the
closed
and
open
string
sector.
The
singularities
in
the
fluxes
then
get
naturally
resolved
by
taking
the
true
solution
to
be
a
time-dependent
process
in
which
flux
gets
attracted
towards
the
brane
and
subsequently
annihilates.
