beautiful
approaches
to
the
fine-tuning
problem
\\
via
extending
index
theorems,
we
calculate
abelian
integration
cycles.
our
calculation
of
general
localization
(excluding
D7
branes
wrapping
a
P^n)
provides
adjoint
TQFTs
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines.
our
results
confirm
that
the
compactification
of
F-Theory

follows
from
boundary-duality
in
Heterotic
string
theory
,
in
the
approximation
that
Z-bosons
follow
from
a
solution
to
the
strong
CP
problem.
surprisingly,
over
the
last
decade,
some
work
was
done
discussing
type
IIA
.
we
take
a
nonperturbative
approach.
the
calculation
of
a
holographic
superconductor
localizes
to
a
RS1
background
of
H_m(dS_m,\Z)
holonomy.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
essential.
