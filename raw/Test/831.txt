Ramification
Points
of
Seiberg-Witten
Curves
\\
When
the
Seiberg-Witten
curve
of
a
four-dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetric
gauge
theory
wraps
a
Riemann
surface
as
a
multi-sheeted
cover,
a
topological
constraint
requires
that
in
general
the
curve
should
develop
ramification
points.
We
show
that,
while
some
of
the
branch
points
of
the
covering
map
can
be
identified
with
the
punctures
that
appear
in
the
work
of
Gaiotto,
the
ramification
points
give
us
additional
branch
points
whose
locations
on
the
Riemann
surface
can
have
dependence
not
only
on
gauge
coupling
parameters
but
on
Coulomb
branch
parameters
and
mass
parameters
of
the
theory.
We
describe
how
these
branch
points
can
help
us
to
understand
interesting
physics
in
various
limits
of
the
parameters,
including
Argyres-Seiberg
duality
and
Argyres-Douglas
fixed
points.
