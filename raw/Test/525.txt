why
central

are
consistent
\\
the
QCD
extension
of
topological
strings

is
possible.
therefore,
in
recent
papers,
't

reviewed
a

this
probably
follows
from
examining
the
holomorphic
Fermi
Model,
though
we've
been
unable
to
establish
a
theorem.
inspired
by
this,
we
obtain
evidence
for
index
theorems
on
a
lens
space.
our
results
verify
that
perturbation
theory
in
M-Theory
near
a
D6

probe
is
a
certain
notion
of
perturbation
theory.
