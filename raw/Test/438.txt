Non-commutative
holographic
QCD
and
DC
conductivity
\\
In
this
paper
we
consider
non-commutative
Sakai-Sugimoto
model
by
using
D8-branes
probing
the
background
generated
by
D4-branes
with
an
NSNS
B-field
turned
on.
We
study
response
of
the
system
to
external
electric
field
which
could
be
parallel
to
orthogonal
to
the
background
B-field.
We
compute
the
conductivity
as
a
function
of
temperature
and
non-commutativity
parameters.
Non-commutativity
effect,
depending
on
the
relative
orientation
of
external
and
background
electromagnetic
fields,
may
increase
or
decrease
the
conductivity.
