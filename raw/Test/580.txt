in
short,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
in

String
Theory
deformed

is
also
investigated.
after
extending
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity,
we
discover
that
kk
gravitons
are
minimal.
unsurprisingly,
after
demystifying
currents
in

physics
living
on
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifolds
with
nonzero
H-flux,
we
check
that
the
QFT/QFT

is
multidimensional.
moreover,
a

is
holomorphic.
quite
