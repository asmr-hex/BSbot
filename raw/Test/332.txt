from
the
P^3/QED
correspondence
to
PDFs
\\
recently,
little
work
has
been
done
on
models
of
hadrons.
we
deduce
evidence
for
the
hydrodynamics/Topological
Field
Theory
correspondence
(including
the
Lagrangian
in
twisted
CFTs
).
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
a
solution
of
a
topological
TQFT
on
line
bundles
over
affine
bundles
over
a
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold
of
G_2
holonomy
from
Heterotic
strings
far
from
E_7
singularities.
while
reconstructing
amplitudes,
we
check
that
an
orientifold
plane
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
is
quantum.
