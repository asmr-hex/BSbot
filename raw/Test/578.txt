Exact
Large
R-charge
Correlators
in
ABJM
Theory
\\
We
construct
a
class
of
operators,
given
by
Schur
polynomials,
in
ABJM
theory.
By
computing
two
point
functions
at
finite
$N$
we
confirm
these
are
diagonal
for
this
class
of
operators
in
the
free
field
limit.
We
also
calculate
exact
three
and
multi
point
correlators
in
the
zero
coupling
limit.
Finally,
we
consider
a
particular
nontrivial
background
produced
by
an
operator
with
an
$R$-charge
of
$O(N^2$.
We
show
that
the
nonplanar
corrections
(which
can
no
longer
be
neglected,
even
at
large
$N$)
can
be
resummed
to
give
a
$1/(N+M)$
expansion
for
correlators
computed
in
this
background.
