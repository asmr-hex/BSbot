Generating
higher-derivative
couplings
in
N=2
supergravity
\\
Using
a
recently
developed
off-shell
formulation
for
general
4D
N=2
supergravity-matter
systems,
we
propose
a
construction
to
generate
higher
derivative
couplings.
We
address
here
mainly
the
interactions
of
tensor
and
vector
multiplets,
but
the
construction
is
quite
general.
For
a
certain
subclass
of
terms,
the
action
is
naturally
written
as
an
integral
over
3/4
of
the
Grassmann
coordinates
of
superspace.
