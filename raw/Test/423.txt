Schwinger-Dyson
equations
for
gauge-invariant
correlators
\\
The
formalism
for
Schwinger-Dyson
equations
of
Wilson
loops,
as
developed
by
Eguchi,
Weingarten,
and
Foerster,
is
extended
to
include
connected
correlators.
These
should
allow
one
to
study
propagators
and
interactions
of
glueball
fields
without
having
to
handle
gauge
dependent
fields
such
as
gluons
an
ghosts.
Some
steps
towards
a
solution
are
made.
