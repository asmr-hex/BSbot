towards
the
solution
of
String
theories

\\
partial
progress
has
been
made
in
recent
papers
on
unparticle
physics.
we
take
a
tachyonic
approach
to
the
reduction
of
topological
strings
far
from
a
(p,q)
brane
probe
(including
the
mu
problem).
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
quintessence,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
general
Nekrosov's
equations.
our
results
confirm
that
some
general
computations
are
holographic,
by
dilation
symmetry.
