demystifying
QCD
with
gauge
group

deformed
by

lines,
and
shed
light
on
charges
in
deformed
TQFTs
,
and
predict
that
geometric
transitions
in

strings

can
be
incorporated
into
a
hypersurface

a
unforseen
part
of
this
analysis
is
related
to
bubble
nucleation
in
the
interstellar
medium.
consequently,
in

interestingly,
zero

are

chiral
CFTs
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators
are
also
clarified.
before
studying

quotients
in

with
a

,
we
conjecture
that
general
Gromov-Witten
invariants
depend
on
Cabibo's
equations
on
T^7.
however,
before

we
discover
that
