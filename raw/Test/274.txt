Thermal
soliton
correlation
functions

\\
We
show
that
the
quantum
solitons
occurring
in
theories
describing
a
complex
scalar
field
in
(1+1)-dimensions
with
a
Z(N)
symmetry
may
be
identified
with
sine-Gordon
quantum
solitons
in
the
phase
of
this
field.
Then
using
both
the
Euclidean
thermal
Green
function
of
the
two-dimensional
free
massless
scalar
field
in
coordinate
space
and
its
dual,
we
obtain
an
explicit
series
expression
for
the
corresponding
solitonic
correlation
function
at
finite
temperature.
