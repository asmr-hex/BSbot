Two-Center
Black
Holes,
Qubits
and
Elliptic
Curves
\\
We
relate
the
U-duality
invariants
characterizing
two-center
extremal
black
hole
solutions
in
the
stu,
st^2
and
t^3
models
of
N=2,
d=4
supergravity
to
the
basic
invariants
used
to
characterize
entanglement
classes
of
four-qubit
systems.
For
the
elementary
example
of
a
D0D4-D2D6
composite
in
the
t^3
model
we
illustrate
how
these
entanglement
invariants
are
related
to
some
of
the
physical
properties
of
the
two-center
solution.
Next
we
show
that
it
is
possible
to
associate
elliptic
curves
to
charge
configurations
of
two-center
composites.
The
hyperdeterminant
of
the
hypercube,
a
four-qubit
polynomial
invariant
of
order
24
with
2894276
terms,
is
featuring
the
j
invariant
of
the
elliptic
curve.
We
present
some
evidence
that
this
quantity
and
its
straightforward
generalization
should
play
an
important
role
in
the
physics
of
two-center
solutions.
