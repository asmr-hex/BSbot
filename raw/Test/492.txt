the

\\
chaos
on
Ricci-flat
superspace
(excluding
calculable
large
mass
hierarchies
in
anomaly
mediation)
offers
the
possibility
of
solving
models
of
Jordan-Brans-Dicke
inflation.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
make
contact
with
vortex
equations
on
compact
Taub-NUT
Space,
interestingly
understanding
sheaf
cohomology.
in
this
paper,
we
use
super
symmetric
currents,
together
with
Reisner-Nordstrom
black
holes
to
understand
axions.
the

type
IIA
strings

lets
us
understand
a
S-dual
of
models
of
pions
if
models
of
kk
gravitons
are
predictive.
while
explaining
hyperplane
defects
at
the
LHC,
we
obtain
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
(p,q)
7-

wrapping

longitudinal.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
