Theories
with
Finite
Green's
Functions
\\
The
addition
of
certain
nonrenormalizable
terms
to
the
usual
action
density
of
a
free
scalar
field
leads
to
nonrenormalizable
theories
whose
exact
euclidian
and
minkowskian
Green's
functions
are
less
singular
than
those
of
the
free
theory.
In
some
cases,
they
are
finite.
One
may
use
lattice
methods
to
extract
physical
information
from
these
less-singular,
nonrenormalizable
theories.
