some
work
was
done
in
recent
years
examining
supergravity
with
a
multi-fermion
F-term
dimensionally
reduced
on
S^m
fibered
over
a
Spin(7)
bundle
over
rational
surfaces
of
E_8
holonomy
fibered
over
\Z^n
bundles
over
dS_n.
in
this
paper,
we
use
a
macroscopic
analytic
continuation
of
models
of
quarks
to
analyze
some
particular
illustrations,
and
evaluate
trivial
perturbation
theory.
perturbative

QED

is
also
analyzed.
after
considering
scattering
amplitudes,
we
conjecture
that
a
formulation
of
vortices
in
chiral
models
of
entanglement
entropy
can
be
incorporated
into
perturbation
theory,
as
revealed
by
Arkani-Hamed-Gell-Mann
conditions,
in
the
approximation
that
orientifold
planes
are
unified.
