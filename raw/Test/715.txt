Some
phenomenological
aspects
of
Type
IIB/F-theory
string
compactifications
\\
This
article
is
the
PhD
thesis
of
the
author.
It
is
focused
on
Type
II
compactifications
because
of
the
potential
for
the
construction
of
realistic
MSSM-like
compactifications.
In
particular
we
concentrate
in
Type
IIB
Calabi-Yau
orientifolds
and
its
non-perturbative
realization:
F-theory.
These
sort
of
models,
have
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
during
recent
years
due
to
their
phenomenological
interest.
The
first
part
is
devoted
to
an
introductory
survey
of
some
concepts
and
aspects
of
Type
II
vacua
like
e.g.
the
low
energy
effective
action
or
soft
terms.
It
is
also
included
a
brief
presentation
of
F-theory
stressing
the
phenomenological
interest
of
local
models.
In
the
second
part
we
present
an
analysis
of
the
theoretical
and
phenomenological
issues
of
modulus
dominated
SUSY
breaking.
In
addition
it
is
examined
its
status
in
comparison
with
recent
LHC
data.
Finally,
the
third
part
is
devoted
to
the
analysis
of
flux
and
instanton
effects
on
local
F-theory
models.
Yukawas
and
matter
fields
wave
functions
corresponding
to
these
models
are
calculated.
The
results
may
allow
for
an
understanding
of
the
problem
of
fermion
hierarchies
in
the
Standard
Model.
