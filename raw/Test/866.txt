Accelerated
detectors
in
Dirac
vacuum:
the
effects
of
horizon
fluctuations
\\
We
consider
an
Unruh-DeWitt
detector
interacting
with
a
massless
Dirac
field.
Assuming
that
the
detector
is
moving
along
an
hyperbolic
trajectory,
we
modeled
the
effects
of
fluctuations
in
the
event
horizon
using
a
Dirac
equation
with
random
coefficients.
First,
we
develop
the
perturbation
theory
for
the
fermionic
field
in
a
random
media.
Further
we
evaluate
corrections
due
to
the
randomness
in
the
response
function
associated
to
different
model
detectors.
