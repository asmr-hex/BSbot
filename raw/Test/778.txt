Structures

Non-commutative/non-associative
Closed
String
Geometry
\\
In
this
paper
we
discuss
non-commutative
and
non-associative
geometries
that
emerge
in
the
context
of
non-geometric
closed
string
backgrounds.
T-duality
and
doubled
field
theory
plays
an
important
role
in
formulating
the
corresponding
effective
action
for
these
kind
of
non-geometric
string
backgrounds.
As
we
will
argue,
the
emerging
non-commutative
and
non-associative
algebras
for
the
closed
string
(dual)
coordinates
and
(dual)
momenta
can
be
mathematically
described
by
a
twisted
Poisson
structure,
in
closed
analogy
to
the
phase
space
of
a
point
particle
moving
in
the
field
of
a
magnetic
monopole.
