On
the
renormalisation
group
for
the
boundary
Truncated
Conformal
Space
Approach
\\
In
this
paper
we
continue
the
study
of
the
truncated
conformal
space
approach
to
perturbed
boundary
conformal
field
theories.
This
approach
to
perturbation
theory
suffers
from
a
renormalisation
of
the
coupling
constant
and
a
multiplicative
renormalisation
of
the
Hamiltonian.
We
show
how
these
two
effects
can
be
predicted
by
both
physical
and
mathematical
arguments
and
prove
that
they
are
correct
to
leading
order
for
all
states
in
the
TCSA
system.
We
check
these
results
using
the
TCSA
applied
to
the
tri-critical
Ising
model
and
the
Yang-Lee
model.
We
also
study
the
TCSA
of
an
irrelevant
(non-renormalisable)
perturbation
and
find
that,
while
the
convergence
of
the
coupling
constant
and
energy
scales
are
problematic,
the
renormalised
and
rescaled
spectrum
remain
a
very
good
fit
to
the
exact
result,
and
we
find
a
numerical
relationship
between
the
IR
and
UV
couplings
describing
a
particular
flow.
Finally
we
study
the
large
coupling
behaviour
of
TCSA
and
show
that
it
accurately
encompasses
several
different
fixed
points.
