The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
generalize
the
self-duality
equation
by
Tchrakian
and
Corrigan
et.
al..
Novel
generalized
self-duality
equations
on
higher-dimensional
spaces
are
discussed.
This
class
of
equations
includes
the
usual
self-duality
equation
for
four-dimensional
spaces.
Some
of
the
generalized
self-duality
equations
over-determine
configurations
and
the
existence
of
solutions
is
not
trivial.
Several
examples
of
solutions
of
the
equations
are
demonstrated.
%Application
of
these
solutions
in
various
models
is
attractive
as
shown
in
the
case
of
instanton.
As
an
application
of
the
equations,
it
is
proved
that
some
of
those
solutions
solve
the
equations
of
motion
derived
from
rotationally-invariant
actions,
which
consist
of
single-trace
terms
and
are
second-order
in
the
time
derivative.
