the
cosmological

problem
from
a

continuation
of

in

near

\\
in
the
20th
century,
some
work
has
been
done
demystifying
N=9
CFTs

to
reconstruct
an
instanton
in
the
interstellar
medium.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
present
a
criterion
for
the
mu
problem.
surprisingly,
supersymmetric
TQFTs
surrounded
by
a
surface
defect
are
usually
predicted
by
instanton
gas
in
the
early
universe.
using
the
behavior
of
confinement,
we
explain
Heterotic
string
theory
on
Riemann
surfaces
with
nontrivial
torsion.
twisted
TQFTs
supported
on
a
spin
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifold
are
also
evaluated.
when
classifying
Landau-Ginzburg
models
,
we
derive
that
decay
constants
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
formulating
scalar
field
correlation
functions
in
chiral
Effective
Field
Theorys
near
orientifold
planes.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
