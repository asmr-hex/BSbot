On
cubic
AdS
interactions
of
mixed-symmetry
higher
spins
\\
The
problem
of
finding
consistent
cubic
AdS
interactions
of
massless
mixed-symmetry
higher-spin
fields
is
recast
into
a
system
of
partial
differential
equations
that
can
be
solved
for
given
spins
of
the
particles
entering
the
cubic
vertices.
For
simplicity,
we
consider
fields
with
two
families
of
indices
for
which
some
examples
of
interactions
are
explicitly
discussed.
