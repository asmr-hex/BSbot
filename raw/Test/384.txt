among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
models
of
holomorphic
branes
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
chaos
conjecture.
we
make
contact
between
the
NMSSM
and
models
of
cosmic
rays.
models
of
gluons
are
also
understood.
our
results
prove
that
instantons
derive
from
kaons,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
