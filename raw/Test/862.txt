Chiral
vortices
in
relativistic
hydrodynamics
\\
Towards
modelling
the
charge
asymmetry
observed
in
heavy
ion
collisions,
we
present
here
analytic
solutions
of
relativistic
hydrodynamics
containing
parity
violating
and
anomalous
terms
at
the
first
order
in
the
hydrodynamic
approximation.
These
terms
can
induce
chiral
magnetic
and
chiral
vortical
effect
leading
to
the
generation
of
the
charge
asymmetry.
We
also
consider
sphaleron
solutions
with
non
trivial
winding
number
to
model
the
phenomenon.
We
calculate
the
net
chiral
charge
difference
produced
in
our
solutions.
We
anticipate
their
relevance
also
in
the
context
of
baryogenesis
in
early
universe,
neutron
star
and
some
condensed
matter
situations.
