Disentangling
the
Black
Hole
Vacuum
\\
We
study
the
question
whether
disentanglement
of
Hawking
radiation
can
be
achieved
with
any
local
operation.
We
assume
that
the
operation
we
look
for
is
unitary
and
can
be
described
by
a
Bogoliubov
transformation.
This
allows
to
formulate
requirements
on
the
operation
of
disentanglement.
We
then
show
that
these
requirements
can
be
fulfilled
by
a
timelike
boundary
condition
in
the
near-horizon
area
and
that
the
local
observer
does
not
notice
the
presence
of
the
boundary
and
does
not
encounter
a
firewall.
