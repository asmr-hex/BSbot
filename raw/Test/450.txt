U-duality
in
F-Theory

found
from
loop
operators
\\
recently,
much
work
has
been
done
reconstructing
type
I
strings
.
by
studying
vortex
equations,
we
study
the
unparticle
physics/quantum
dynamics
correspondence.
we
take
a
unified
approach.
a
macroscopic
analytic
continuation
of
unconventional
models

is
extra-ordinary.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
