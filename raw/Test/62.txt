Gauge
and
Supersymmetric
Invariance
of
a
Boundary
Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson
Theory
\\
In
this
paper
we
will
discuss
the
effect
of
a
having
a
boundary
on
the
supersymmetric
invariance
and
gauge
invariance
of
the
Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson
(BLG)
Theory.
We
will
show
that
even
though
the
supersymmetry
and
gauge
invariance
of
the
original
BLG
theory
is
broken
due
to
the
presence
of
a
boundary,
it
restored
by
the
addition
of
suitable
boundary
terms.
In
fact,
to
achieve
the
gauge
invariance
of
this
theory,
we
will
have
to
introduce
new
boundary
degrees
of
freedom.
The
boundary
theory
obeyed
by
these
new
boundary
degrees
of
freedom
will
be
shown
to
be
a
generalization
of
the
gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten
model,
with
the
generators
of
the
Lie
algebra
replaced
by
the
generators
of
the
Lie
3-algebra.
The
gauge
and
supersymmetry
variations
of
the
boundary
theory
will
exactly
cancel
the
boundary
terms
generated
by
the
gauge
and
supersymmetric
variations
of
the
bulk
theory.
