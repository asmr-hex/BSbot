On
the
Derivation
of
the
Exact
Slope
Function
\\
In
this
note
we
give
a
simple
derivation
of
the
exact
slope
function
conjectured
by
Basso
for
the
anomalous
dimensions
of
Wilson
operators
in
the
sl2
sector
of
planar
N=4
Super-Yang-Mills
theory.
We
also
discuss
generalizations
of
this
result
for
higher
charges
and
other
sectors.
