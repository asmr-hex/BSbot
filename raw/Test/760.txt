Scalar

Fuzzy

\\
We
present
a
manifestly
Spin(5)
invariant
construction
of
squashed
fuzzy
$CP^3$
as
a
fuzzy
$S^2$
bundle
over
fuzzy
$S^4$.
We
develop
the
necessary
projectors
and
exhibit
the
squashing
in
terms
of
the
radii
of
the
$S^2$
and
$S^4$.
Our
analysis
allows
us
give
both
scalar
and
spinor
fuzzy
action
functionals
whose
low
lying
modes
are
truncated
versions
of
those
of
a
commutative
$S^4$.
