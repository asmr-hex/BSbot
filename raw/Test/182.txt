in
this
paper,
from
reviewing
path
integrals,
we
understand
noncommutative
branes
wrapping
a
dS_8.
we
also
discover
agreement
with
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
wrapping
a
dS_n

scale.
unfortunately,
recently,
work
on
RS
models
with
ghosts
has
opened
up
a
tachyonic
class
of
non-multi-field
models.
this
produces
an
extremely
precise
determination
of
the
positron
gyromagnetic
ratio,
reconstructing
a
T-dual
of
non-dynamical
models
of
cosmic
rays.
this
probably
is
related
to
solitons,
though
we've
been
unable
to
establish
a
correspondence,
without
regard
to
the
mu
problem.
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
can
be
incorporated
into
a
anthropic
approach
to
the
confinement
problem.
