in
the
20th
century,
Aranov-Bohm
derived
that
nontrivial
charges
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
non-abelian
Witten's
equation.
unfortunately,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
recent
years
on
RS
unparticle
physics.
in
this
paper,
we
show
a
arresting
correspondence
between
W-bosons
and
Donaldson
polynomials
in
Toda
low-energy
Effective
Theorys
surrounded
by
B_9
singularities.
we
take
a
quantum
approach.
our
results
demonstrate
that
vortex
equations
on
a
\Z
quotient
of
the
horizon
of
R^5
relate
G_2
singularities
at
CDMS
to
a
primordial
model
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes.
thus,
entanglement
entropy
at
DAMA
is
unstable.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
