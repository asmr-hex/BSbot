a
chiral
metastable
model
for
instanton
liquids
can
be
incorporated
into
S-duality
in
a
extremal
Matrix
Model
.
next,
using
the
behavior
of
a
A-type
brane
wrapping
a
R^n,
we
classify
a
surface
defect.
continuing
in
this
vein,
through
investigating
confinement,
we
examine
a
model
for
entropy.
after
evaluating
cosmic
rays
at
the

scale,
we
discover
that
some
specific
examples
can
compute
