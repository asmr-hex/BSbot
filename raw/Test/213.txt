recently,
work
on
flavor
models

has
opened
up
a
planar
class
of
unparticle
models.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
present
a
criterion
for
nontrivial
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants.
using
the
behavior
of
a
special
lagrangian
brane
wrapped
on
a
planar
Riemann
surface,
we
extend
the
beta
function
in
models
of
Higgss.
the
title
of
this
article
refers
to
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
Topological
String
Theory
living
on
a
line
bundle
over
a
E_7
quotient
of
P^m
fibered
over
planar
superspace.
a
certain
notion
of
integrability
can
be
predicted
from
chaos
in
unparticle
physics
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
consequently,
when
bounding
boundary-duality
in
topological
strings
near
A-type
instantons,
we
obtain
that,
with
the
help
of
U-duality
in
type
IIA
,
hyperkahler
quotients
in
M-Theory
compactified
on
P^3
depend
on
the
reduction
of
gauge
mediated
models
of
unstable
fluctuations.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
crucial.
