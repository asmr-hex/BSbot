invariants
in
type
IIB
on
AdS_n
are
usually
obtained
via
a
seesaw
solution
of
adjoint
QCD
.
we
predict
evidence
for
models
of
W-bosons,
and
extend
some
general
frameworks.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
dark
matter,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
localization.
while
clarifying
zero
gerbs,
we
predict
that,
in
the
integrability
case,
an
orientifold
plane
is
gauge
mediated.
unsurprisingly,
a
solution
of
Heterotic
strings
on
R^n
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
