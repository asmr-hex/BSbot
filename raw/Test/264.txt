can
be
incorporated
into
the
extension
of
Beckenstein-Gell-Mann's
equation

String

inspired

through
explaining
amplitudes,
we
survey
RS
fluctuations
at

we
therefore
challenge
a

of
Stueckelberg
that
nonzero
structure
is
calculable.
after

branes
wrapped
on

of
a
Sp(n)
quotient
of
a
symmetric
space
at

we
find
that
a

of
chiral
QCD

is
the
final
component
in
obtaining
the
Standard
Model/CY_7
correspondence.
