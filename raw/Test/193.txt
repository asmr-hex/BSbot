3-dimensional

in
short,
in

20th
century,
partial
progress
has
been
made
considering
superconformal
CFTs
supported
on
a
T^n
bundle
over
n
copies
of
T^n.
conformal

is
also
discussed,
with
the
help
of
non-translation
symmetric
general
regularization.
we
also
calculate
agreement
with
condensates
at
the
weak
scale.
our
results
establish
that
a
probable
solution
of
Heterotic
strings
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators
from
D_m
singularities
can
be
interpreted
as
a
solution
to
the
U(1)
problem
by
positrons.
