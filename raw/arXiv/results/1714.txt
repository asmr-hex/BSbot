Glimpses
into
the
early
Universe
\\
This
contribution
gives
a
brief
overview
of
the
theoretical
ideas
underlying
our
current
understanding
of
the
early
Universe.
Confronting
the
predictions
of
the
early
Universe
models
with
cosmological
observations,
in
particular
of
the
cosmic
microwave
background
fluctuations,
will
improve
our
knowledge
about
the
physics
of
the
primordial
Universe.
