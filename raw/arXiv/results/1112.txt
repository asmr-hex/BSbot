Eternal
Symmetree
\\
In
this
paper
we
introduce
a
simple
discrete
stochastic
model
of
eternal
inflation
that
shares
many
of
the
most
important
features
of
the
continuum
theory
as
it
is
now
understood.
The
model
allows
us
to
construct
a
multiverse
and
rigorously
analyze
its
properties.
Although
simple
and
easy
to
solve,
it
has
a
rich
mathematical
structure
underlying
it.
Despite
the
discreteness
of
the
space-time
the
theory
exhibits
an
unexpected
non-perturbative
analog
of
conformal
symmetry
that
acts
on
the
boundary
of
the
geometry.
The
symmetry
is
rooted
in
the
mathematical
properties
of
trees,
p-adic
numbers,
and
ultrametric
spaces;
and
in
the
physical
property
of
detailed
balance.
We
provide
self-contained
elementary
explanations
of
the
unfamiliar
mathematical
concepts,
which
have
have
also
appeared
in
the
study
of
the
p-adic
string.
