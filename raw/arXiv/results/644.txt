Uniqueness
of
canonical
tensor
model
with
local
time
\\
Canonical
formalism
of
the
rank-three
tensor
model
has
recently
been
proposed,
in
which
"local"
time
is
consistently
incorporated
by
a
set
of
first
class
constraints.
By
brute-force
analysis,
this
paper
shows
that
there
exist
only
two
forms
of
a
Hamiltonian
constraint
which
satisfies
the
following
assumptions:
(i)
A
Hamiltonian
constraint
has
one
index.
(ii)
The
kinematical
symmetry
is
given
by
an
orthogonal
group.
(iii)
A
consistent
first
class
constraint
algebra
is
formed
by
a
Hamiltonian
constraint
and
the
generators
of
the
kinematical
symmetry.
(iv)
A
Hamiltonian
constraint
is
invariant
under
time
reversal
transformation.
(v)
A
Hamiltonian
constraint
is
an
at
most
cubic
polynomial
function
of
canonical
variables.
(vi)
There
are
no
disconnected
terms
in
a
constraint
algebra.
The
two
forms
are
the
same
except
for
a
slight
difference
in
index
contractions.
The
Hamiltonian
constraint
which
was
obtained
in
the
previous
paper
and
behaved
oddly
under
time
reversal
symmetry
can
actually
be
transformed
to
one
of
them
by
a
canonical
change
of
variables.
The
two-fold
uniqueness
is
shown
up
to
the
potential
ambiguity
of
adding
terms
which
vanish
in
the
limit
of
pure
gravitational
physics.
