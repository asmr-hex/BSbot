Quantum
Action
Principle
with
Generalized
Uncertainty
Principle
\\
One
of
the
common
features
in
all
promising
candidates
of
quantum
gravity
is
the
existence
of
a
minimal
length
scale,
which
naturally
emerges
with
a
generalized
uncertainty
principle,
or
equivalently
a
modified
commutation
relation.
Schwinger's
quantum
action
principle
was
modified
to
incorporate
this
modification,
and
was
applied
to
the
calculation
of
the
kernel
of
a
free
particle,
partly
recovering
the
result
previously
studied
using
path
integral.
