Unbounded
energies
of
debris
from
head-on
particle
collisions
near
black
holes
\\
If
two
particles
move
toward
a
black
hole
and
collide
near
the
horizon,
the
energy
E_{c.m.}
in
the
centre
of
mass
can
grow
unbounded.
This
is
a
so-called
Ba\~nados-Silk-West
(BSW)
effect.
One
of
problems
creating
obstacles
to
the
possibility
of
its
observation
consists
in
that
individual
energy
E
of
a
fragment
at
infinity
remains
finite
because
of
redshift.
We
show
that
in
the
case
of
head-on
collision,
debris
may
have
unbounded
energy
E.
An
essential
ingredient
of
this
scenario
is
a
particle
moving
away
from
a
black
hole
in
the
near-horizon
region.
It
can
appear
due
to
precedent
collision
that
implies
multiple
scattering.
