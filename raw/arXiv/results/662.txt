Hyperbolic
vortices
with
large
magnetic
flux
\\
There
has
been
some
recent
interest
in
the
study
of
non-abelian
BPS
monopoles
in
the
limit
of
large
magnetic
charge.
Most
investigations
have
used
a
magnetic
bag
approximation,
in
which
spherical
symmetry
is
assumed
within
an
abelian
description.
In
particular,
this
approach
has
been
used
to
suggest
the
existence
of
two
types
of
magnetic
bag,
with
differing
distributions
of
the
zeros
of
the
Higgs
field,
together
with
multi-layer
structures,
containing
several
magnetic
bags.
This
paper
is
concerned
with
the
analogous
situation
of
abelian
BPS
vortices
in
the
hyperbolic
plane,
in
the
limit
of
large
magnetic
flux.
This
system
has
the
advantage
that
explicit
exact
solutions
can
be
obtained
and
compared
with
a
magnetic
bag
approximation.
Exact
BPS
vortex
solutions
are
presented
that
are
analogous
to
the
two
types
of
magnetic
bags
predicted
for
BPS
monopoles
and
it
is
shown
that
these
structures
can
be
combined
to
produce
exact
multi-layer
solutions.
