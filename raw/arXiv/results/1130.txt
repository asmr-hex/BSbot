Chronology
protection
in
stationary
3D
spacetimes
\\
We
address
chronology
protection
in
stationary,
rotationally
symmetric
spacetimes
in
2+1
dimensional
gravity,
focusing
on
the
case
of
negative
cosmological
constant.
We
show
that,
if
such
spacetimes
contain
closed
timelike
curves,
they
belong
to
one
of
the
following
two
classes:
(i)
bad
asymptotics:
the
boundary
itself
contains
closed
timelike
curves,
or
(ii)
unphysical
stress
tensor
in
the
bulk:
the
matter
stress
tensor
violates
the
null
energy
condition.
We
illustrate
these
properties
in
a
class
of
examples
involving
rotating
dust
in
anti-de
Sitter
space
and
comment
on
the
use
of
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence
to
study
chronology
protection.
