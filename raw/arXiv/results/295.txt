Holography
without
translational
symmetry
\\
We
propose
massive
gravity
as
a
holographic
framework
for
describing
a
class
of
strongly
interacting
quantum
field
theories
with
broken
translational
symmetry.
Bulk
gravitons
are
assumed
to
have
a
Lorentz-breaking
mass
term
as
a
substitute
for
spatial
inhomogeneities.
This
breaks
momentum-conservation
in
the
boundary
field
theory.
At
finite
chemical
potential,
the
gravity
duals
are
charged
black
holes
in
asymptotically
anti-de
Sitter
spacetime.
The
conductivity
in
these
systems
generally
exhibits
a
Drude
peak
that
approaches
a
delta
function
in
the
massless
gravity
limit.
Furthermore,
the
optical
conductivity
shows
an
emergent
scaling
law:
$|\sigma(\omega)|
\approx
{A
\over
\omega^{\alpha}}
+
B$.
This
result
is
consistent
with
that
found
earlier
by
Horowitz,
Santos,
and
Tong
who
introduced
an
explicit
inhomogeneous
lattice
into
the
system.
