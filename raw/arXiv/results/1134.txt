Toward
Higher
Spin
dS3/CFT2
\\
I
take
steps
toward
the
construction
of
a
CFT
dual
to
Vasiliev's
higher
spin
gravity
in
three
dimensional
de
Sitter
space.
There
are
two
main
claims.
The
first
is
that
higher
spin
de
Sitter
symmetries
are
related
to
extended
Virasoro
symmetries,
as
in
AdS;
this
is
verified
explicitly
for
the
case
of
W_3
asymptotic
symmetry.
The
associated
chiral
algebra
has
imaginary
central
charge.
The
second
(conjectural)
claim,
inspired
by
work
of
Gaberdiel
and
Gopakumar
in
AdS_3/CFT_2,
is
that
an
appropriate
CFT
can
be
identified
as
an
exotic
non-unitary
WZW
coset
model
at
complex
level.
