Faddeev-Popov
ghosts
in
quantum
gravity
beyond
perturbation
theory
\\
We
study
the
Faddeev-Popov
ghost
sector
of
asymptotically
safe
quantum
gravity,
which
becomes
non-perturbative
in
the
ultraviolet.
We
point
out
that
nonzero
matter-ghost
couplings
and
higher-order
ghost
self-interactions
exist
at
a
non-Gaussian
fixed
point
for
the
gravitational
couplings,
i.e.,
in
the
ultraviolet.
Thus
the
ghost
sector
in
this
non-perturbative
ultraviolet
completion
does
not
keep
the
structure
of
a
simple
Faddeev-Popov
determinant.
We
discuss
implications
of
the
new
ghost
couplings
for
the
Renormalization
Group
flow
in
gravity,
the
form
of
the
ultraviolet
completion,
and
the
relevant
couplings,
i.e.,
free
parameters,
of
the
theory.
