\\
In
this
paper,
with
considering
the
nonlinear
electromagnetic
field
coupled
to
Einstein
gravity,
we
obtain
the
higher
dimensional
slowly
rotating
charged
black
hole
solutions.
By
use
of
the
fact
that
the
temperature
of
the
extreme
black
hole
is
zero,
we
find
that
these
solutions
may
be
interpreted
as
black
hole
solutions
with
inner
(Cauchy)
and
outer
(event)
horizons
provide
that
the
mass
parameter
$m$
is
greater
than
an
extremal
value
$m_{ext}$,
an
extreme
black
hole
if
$m=m_{ext}$
and
a
naked
singularity
otherwise.
Also,
we
find
that
the
asymptotic
behavior
of
the
spacetime
is
not
anti
deSitter
for
the
special
values
of
the
nonlinearity
parameter.
Then,
we
compute
the
ADM
mass,
electrical
charge,
temperature,
entropy,
angular
momentum
and
gyromagnetic
ratio
of
the
solutions.
Calculations
of
the
electromagnetic
field,
electrical
charge,
entropy
and
temperature
showed
that
they
are
sensitive
with
respect
to
the
changing
of
nonlinearity
parameter.
