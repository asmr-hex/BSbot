Reconstruction
of
Baxter
Q-operator
from
Sklyanin
SOV
for
cyclic
representations
of
integrable
quantum
models
\\
In
[1],
the
spectrum
(eigenvalues
and
eigenstates)
of
a
lattice
regularizations
of
the
Sine-Gordon
model
has
been
completely
characterized
in
terms
of
polynomial
solutions
with
certain
properties
of
the
Baxter
equation.
This
characterization
for
cyclic
representations
has
been
derived
by
the
use
of
the
Separation
of
Variables
(SOV)
method
of
Sklyanin
and
by
the
direct
construction
of
the
Baxter
Q-operator
family.
Here,
we
reconstruct
the
Baxter
Q-operator
and
the
same
characterization
of
the
spectrum
by
only
using
the
SOV
method.
This
analysis
allows
us
to
deduce
the
main
features
required
for
the
extension
to
cyclic
representations
of
other
integrable
quantum
models
of
this
kind
of
spectrum
characterization.
