Glueball
and
meson
propagators

in

QCD
\\
We
prove
an
asymptotic
structure
theorem
for
glueball
and
meson
propagators
of
any
spin
in
large-N
QCD
and
in
n=1
SUSY
QCD
with
massless
quarks,
that
determines
asymptotically
the
residues
of
the
poles
of
the
propagators
in
terms
of
their
anomalous
dimensions
and
of
the
spectral
density
of
the
masses.
The
asymptotic
theorem
follows
by
the
severe
constraints
on
the
propagators
in
large-N
QCD
with
massless
quarks,
or
in
any
large-N
confining
asymptotically-free
gauge
theory
massless
in
perturbation
theory,
that
arise
by
perturbation
theory
in
conjunction
with
the
renormalization
group
and
by
the
OPE
on
the
ultraviolet
side.
The
asymptotic
theorem
is
inspired
by
a
recently
proposed
Topological
Field
Theory
(TFT)
underlying
large-N
pure
YM,
that
computes
sums
of
the
scalar
and
of
the
pseudoscalar
correlators
satisfying
the
asymptotic
theorem
and
that
implies
for
the
large-N
joint
scalar
and
pseudoscalar
glueball
spectrum
exact
linearity
in
the
masses
squared.
On
the
infrared
side
we
test
the
prediction
of
the
exact
linearity
in
the
TFT
by
Meyer-Teper
lattice
numerical
computation
of
the
masses
of
the
low-lying
glueballs
in
SU(8)
YM,
finding
accurate
agreement.
Besides,
we
employ
the
aforementioned
ultraviolet
and
infrared
constraints
in
order
to
compare
critically
the
scalar
or
pseudoscalar
glueball
propagators
computed
in
the
framework
of
the
AdS
String/large-N
Gauge
Theory
correspondence
with
those
of
the
TFT
underlying
large-N
YM.
We
find
that
only
the
TFT
satisfies
the
ultraviolet
and
infrared
constraints.
