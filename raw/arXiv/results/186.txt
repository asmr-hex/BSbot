Horava-Lifshitz
Black
Hole
Hydrodynamics
\\
We
consider
the
holographic
hydrodynamics
of
black
holes
in
generally
covariant
gravity
theories
with
a
preferred
time
foliation.
Gravitational
perturbations
in
these
theories
have
spin
two
and
spin
zero
helicity
modes
with
generically
different
speeds.
The
black
hole
solutions
possess
a
spacelike
causal
boundary
called
the
universal
horizon.
We
relate
the
flux
of
the
spin
zero
perturbation
across
the
universal
horizon
to
the
new
dissipative
transport
in
Lifshitz
field
theory
hydrodynamics
found
