Bigravity
in
tetrad
Hamiltonian
formalism
and
matter
couplings
\\
The
tetrad
approach
is
used
to
resolve
the
matrix
square
root
appearing
in
the
dRGT
potential.
Constraints
and
their
algebra
are
derived
for
the
minimal
case.
It
is
shown
that
the
number
of
gravitational
degrees
of
freedom
corresponds
to
one
massless
and
one
massive
gravitational
fields
when
two
sorts
of
matter
separately
interact
with
two
metric
tensors.
The
Boulware-Deser
ghost
is
then
excluded
by
two
second
class
constraints.
In
other
case
when
the
matter
couples
to
a
linear
combination
of
two
tetrads
this
ghost
re-appears.
