Color
Glass
Condensate
in
Schwinger-Keldysh
QCD
\\
Within
the
Schwinger-Keldysh
representation
of
many-body
QCD,
it
is
shown
that
the
leading
quantum
corrections
to
the
strong
classical
color
field
is
classical
in
the
sense
that
the
fluctuation
field
still
obeys
the
classical
Jacobi-field
equation,
while
the
quantum
effects
solely
resides
in
the
fluctuations
of
the
initial
field
configurations.
Within
this
context,
a
systematic
derivation
of
the
JIMWLK
renormalization
group
equation
is
presented.
A
clear
identification
of
the
correct
form
of
gauge
transformation
rules
and
the
correct
form
of
the
matter-field
Lagrangian
in
the
Schwinger-Keldysh
QCD
is
also
presented.
