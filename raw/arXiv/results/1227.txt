Skyrmions,
instantons
and
holography
\\
Some
time
ago,
Atiyah
and
Manton
observed
that
computing
the
holonomy
of
Yang-Mills
instantons
yields
good
approximations
to
static
Skyrmion
solutions
of
the
Skyrme
model.
This
paper
provides
an
extension
and
explanation
of
this
result,
by
proving
that
instanton
holonomies
produce
exact
solutions
of
a
BPS
Skyrme
model,
in
which
the
Skyrme
field
is
coupled
to
a
tower
of
vector
mesons.
Neglecting
any
(or
indeed
all)
of
the
vector
mesons
breaks
the
scale
invariance
and
removes
the
BPS
property
of
the
Skyrmions.
However,
it
is
shown
that
a
truncation
of
the
BPS
Skyrme
theory,
in
which
only
the
first
vector
meson
is
included,
already
moves
the
Skyrme
model
significantly
closer
to
the
BPS
system.
A
theory
that
is
close
to
a
BPS
system
is
required
to
reproduce
the
experimental
data
on
binding
energies
of
nuclei.
A
zero-mode
quantization
of
the
Skyrmion
is
performed
in
the
truncated
BPS
theory
and
the
results
are
compared
to
the
physical
properties
of
the
nucleon.
The
approach
is
an
analogue
in
five-dimensional
Minkowski
spacetime
of
a
recent
holographic
construction
of
a
Skyrme
model
by
Sakai
and
Sugimoto,
based
on
a
string
theory
derivation
of
a
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
theory
in
a
curved
five-dimensional
spacetime.
