Noncommutative
Solitons
and
Quasideterminants
\\
We
discuss
extension
of
soliton
theory
and
integrable
systems
to
noncommutative
spaces,
focusing
on
integrable
aspects
of
noncommutative
anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills
equations.
We
give
wide
class
of
exact
solutions
by
solving
a
Riemann-Hilbert
problem
for
the
Atiyah-Ward
ansatz
and
present
Backlund
transformations
for
the
G=U(2)
noncommutative
anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills
equations.
We
find
that
one
kind
of
noncommutative
determinants,
quasideterminants,
play
crucial
roles
in
the
construction
of
noncommutative
solutions.
We
also
discuss
reduction
of
a
noncommutative
anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills
equation
to
noncommutative
integrable
equations.
This
is
partially
based
on
collaboration
with
C.
Gilson
and
J.
Nimmo
(Glasgow).
