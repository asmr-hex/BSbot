Complex
matrix
model
duality
\\
The
same
complex
matrix
model
calculates
both
tachyon
scattering
for
the
c=1
non-critical
string
at
the
self-dual
radius
and
certain
correlation
functions
of
half-BPS
operators
in
N=4
super-Yang-Mills.
It
is
dual
to
another
complex
matrix
model
where
the
couplings
of
the
first
model
are
encoded
in
the
Kontsevich-like
variables
of
the
second.
The
duality
between
the
theories
is
mirrored
by
the
duality
of
their
Feynman
diagrams.
Analogously
to
the
Hermitian
Kontsevich-Penner
model,
the
correlation
functions
of
the
second
model
can
be
written
as
sums
over
discrete
points
in
subspaces
of
the
moduli
space
of
punctured
Riemann
surfaces.
