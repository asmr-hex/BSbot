The
tensor
hierarchy
algebra
\\
We
introduce
an
infinite-dimensional
Lie
superalgebra
which
is
an
extension
of
the
U-duality
Lie
algebra
of
maximal
supergravity
in
D
dimensions,
for
D
between
3
and
7.
The
level
decomposition
with
respect
to
the
U-duality
Lie
algebra
gives
exactly
the
tensor
hierarchy
of
representations
that
arises
in
gauge
deformations
of
the
theory
described
by
an
embedding
tensor,
for
all
positive
levels
p.
We
prove
that
these
representations
are
always
contained
in
those
coming
from
the
associated
Borcherds-Kac-Moody
superalgebra,
and
we
explain
why
some
of
the
latter
representations
are
not
included
in
the
tensor
hierarchy.
The
most
remarkable
feature
of
our
Lie
superalgebra
is
that
it
does
not
admit
a
triangular
decomposition
like
a
(Borcherds-)Kac-Moody
(super)algebra.
Instead
the
Hodge
duality
relations
between
level
p
and
D-2-p
extend
to
negative
p,
relating
the
representations
at
the
first
two
negative
levels
to
the
supersymmetry
and
closure
constraints
of
the
embedding
tensor.
