Thermodynamics
of
interacting
holographic
dark
energy
with
apparent
horizon
as
an
IR
cutoff
\\
As
soon
as
an
interaction
between
holographic
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
is
taken
into
account,
the
identification
of
IR
cutoff
with
Hubble
radius
$H^{-1}$,
in
flat
universe,
can
simultaneously
drive
accelerated
expansion
and
solve
the
coincidence
problem.
Based
on
this,
we
demonstrate
that
in
a
non-flat
universe
the
natural
choice
for
IR
cutoff
could
be
the
apparent
horizon
radius,
$\tilde{r}_A={1}/{\sqrt{H^2+k/a^2}}$.
We
show
that
any
interaction
of
dark
matter
with
holographic
dark
energy,
whose
infrared
cutoff
is
set
by
the
apparent
horizon
radius,
implies
an
accelerated
expansion
and
a
constant
ratio
of
the
energy
densities
of
both
components
thus
solving
the
coincidence
problem.
We
also
verify
that
for
a
universe
filled
with
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
the
Friedmann
equation
can
be
written
in
the
form
of
the
modified
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
$dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$,
at
apparent
horizon.
In
addition,
the
generalized
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
fulfilled
in
a
region
enclosed
by
the
apparent
horizon.
These
results
hold
regardless
of
the
specific
form
of
dark
energy
and
interaction
term.
Our
study
might
reveal
that
in
an
accelerating
universe
with
spatial
curvature,
the
apparent
horizon
is
a
physical
boundary
from
the
thermodynamical
point
of
view.
