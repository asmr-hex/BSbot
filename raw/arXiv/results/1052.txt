Bubble
collisions
and
measures
of
the
multiverse
\\
To
compute
the
spectrum
of
bubble
collisions
seen
by
an
observer
in
an
eternally-inflating
multiverse,
one
must
choose
a
measure
over
the
diverging
spacetime
volume,
including
choosing
an
"initial"
hypersurface
below
which
there
are
no
bubble
nucleations.
Previous
calculations
focused
on
the
case
where
the
initial
hypersurface
is
pushed
arbitrarily
deep
into
the
past.
Interestingly,
the
observed
spectrum
depends
on
the
orientation
of
the
initial
hypersurface,
however
one's
ability
observe
the
effect
rapidly
decreases
with
the
ratio
of
inflationary
Hubble
rates
inside
and
outside
one's
bubble.
We
investigate
whether
this
conclusion
might
be
avoided
under
more
general
circumstances,
in
particular
placing
the
observer's
bubble
near
the
initial
hypersurface.
We
find
that
it
is
not.
As
a
point
of
reference,
a
substantial
appendix
reviews
relevant
aspects
of
the
measure
problem
of
eternal
inflation.
