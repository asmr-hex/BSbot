Determination
of
Boundary
Contributions
in
Recursion
Relation
\\
In
this
paper,
we
propose
a
new
algorithm
to
systematically
determine
the
missing
boundary
contributions,
when
one
uses
the
BCFW
on-shell
recursion
relation
to
calculate
tree-level
amplitudes
for
general
quantum
field
theories.
After
a
general
introduction
of
this
algorithm,
we
will
use
several
examples
to
demonstrate
this
approach,
including
amplitudes
of
the
color-ordered
phi-4
theory,
the
Yang-Mills
theory,
the
Einstein-Maxwell
theory
and
the
color-ordered
Yukawa
theory.
