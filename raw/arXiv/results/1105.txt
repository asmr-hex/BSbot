Classical
and
quantum
mechanics
of
the
nonrelativistic
Snyder
model
in
curved
space
\\
The
Snyder-de
Sitter
(SdS)
model
is
a
generalization
of
the
Snyder
model
to
a
spacetime
background
of
constant
curvature.
It
is
an
example
of
noncommutative
spacetime
admitting
two
fundamental
scales
besides
the
speed
of
light,
and
is
invariant
under
the
action
of
the
de
Sitter
group.
Here
we
consider
its
nonrelativistic
counterpart,
i.e.
the
Snyder
model
restricted
to
a
three-dimensional
sphere,
and
the
related
model
obtained
by
considering
the
anti-Snyder
model
on
a
pseudosphere,
that
we
call
anti-Snyder-de
Sitter
(aSdS).
