Gravity
vs.
Quantum
theory:
Is
electron
really
pointlike?
\\
The
observable
gravitational
and
electromagnetic
parameters
of
an
electron:
mass
$m$,
spin
$J=\hbar/2$,
charge
$e$
and
magnetic
moment
$ea
=
e\hbar
/(2m)$
indicate
unambiguously
that
the
electron
should
had
the
Kerr-Newman
background
geometry
--
exact
solution
of
the
Einstein-Maxwell
gravity
for
a
charged
and
rotating
black
hole.
Contrary
to
the
widespread
opinion
that
gravity
plays
essential
role
only
on
the
Planck
scales,
the
Kerr-Newman
gravity
displays
a
new
dimensional
parameter
$a
=\hbar/(2m),$
which
for
parameters
of
an
electron
corresponds
to
the
Compton
wavelength
and
turns
out
to
be
very
far
from
the
Planck
scale.
Extremely
large
spin
of
the
electron
with
respect
to
its
mass
produces
the
Kerr
geometry
without
horizon,
which
displays
very
essential
topological
changes
at
the
Compton
distance
resulting
in
a
two-fold
structure
of
the
electron
background.
The
corresponding
gravitational
and
electromagnetic
fields
of
the
electron
are
concentrated
near
the
Kerr
ring,
forming
a
sort
of
a
closed
string,
structure
of
which
is
close
to
the
described
by
Sen
heterotic
string.
The
indicated
by
Gravity
stringlike
structure
of
the
electron
contradicts
to
the
statements
of
Quantum
theory
that
electron
is
pointlike
and
structureless.
However,
it
confirms
the
peculiar
role
of
the
Compton
zone
of
the
"dressed"
electron
and
matches
with
the
known
limit
of
the
localization
of
the
Dirac
electron.
We
discuss
the
relation
of
the
Kerr
string
with
the
low
energy
string
theory
and
with
the
Dirac
theory
of
electron
and
suggest
that
the
predicted
by
the
Kerr-Newman
gravity
closed
string
in
the
core
of
the
electron,
should
be
experimentally
observable
by
the
novel
regime
of
the
high
energy
scattering
--
the
Deeply
Virtual
(or
"nonforward")Compton
Scattering".
