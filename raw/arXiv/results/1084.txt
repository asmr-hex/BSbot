Towards
lattice-regularized
Quantum
Gravity
\\
Using
the
Cartan
formulation
of
General
Relativity,
we
construct
a
well
defined
lattice-regularized
theory
capable
to
describe
large
non-perturbative
quantum
fluctuations
of
the
frame
field
(or
the
metric)
and
of
the
spin
connection.
To
that
end
we
need
to
present
the
tetrad
by
a
composite
field
built
as
a
bilinear
combination
of
fermion
fields.
The
theory
is
explicitly
invariant
under
local
Lorentz
transformations
and,
in
the
continuum
limit,
under
general
covariant
transformations,
or
diffeomorphisms.
Being
well
defined
for
large
and
fast
varying
fields
at
the
ultraviolet
cutoff,
the
theory
simultaneously
has
chances
of
reproducing
standard
General
Relativity
in
the
infrared
continuum
limit.
The
present
regularization
of
quantum
gravity
opens
new
possibilities
of
its
unification
with
the
Standard
Model.
