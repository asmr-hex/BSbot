Integrable
lattice
models
from
four-dimensional
field
theories
\\
This
note
gives
a
general
construction
of
an
integrable
lattice
model
(and
a
solution
of
the
Yang-Baxter
equation
with
spectral
parameter)
from
a
four-dimensional
field
theory
which
is
a
mixture
of
topological
and
holomorphic.
Spin-chain
models
arise
in
this
way
from
a
twisted,
deformed
version
of
N=1
gauge
theory.
