Strong
-
weak
coupling
duality
in
string
theory
allows
us
to
compute
physical
quantities
both
at
the
weak
coupling
end
and
at
the
strong
coupling
end.
Furthermore
perturbative
string
theory
can
be
used
to
compute
corrections
to
the
leading
order
formula
at
both
ends.
We
explore
the
possibility
of
constructing
a
smooth
interpolating
formula
that
agrees
with
the
perturbation
expansion
at
both
ends
and
leads
to
a
fairly
accurate
determination
of
the
quantity
in
consideration
over
the
entire
range
of
the
coupling
constant.
We
apply
this
to
study
the
mass
of
the
stable
non-BPS
state
in
SO(32)
heterotic
/
type
I
string
theory
with
encouraging
results.
In
particular
our
result
suggests
that
after
taking
into
account
one
loop
corrections
to
the
mass
in
the
heterotic
and
type
I
string
theory,
the
interpolating
function
determines
the
mass
within
10%
accuracy
over
the
entire
range
of
coupling
constant.
