Tachyon
Reconstruction
of
Ghost
Dark
Energy
\\
Recently
it
has
been
argued
that
a
possible
source
for
the
dark
energy
may
arise
due
to
the
contribution
to
the
vacuum
energy
of
the
QCD
ghost
in
a
time-dependent
background.
In
this
paper
we
establish
a
connection
between
interacting
ghost
dark
energy
and
tachyon
field.
It
is
demonstrated
that
the
evolution
of
the
ghost
dark
energy
dominated
universe
can
be
described
completely
by
a
single
tachyon
scalar
field.
The
potential
and
the
dynamics
of
the
tachyon
field
are
reconstructed
according
to
the
evolutionary
behavior
of
ghost
energy
density.
