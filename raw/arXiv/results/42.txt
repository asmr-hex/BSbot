Natural
Inflation
and
Universal
Hypermultiplet
\\
A
novel
framework
is
proposed
for
embedding
the
natural
inflation
into
the
type
IIA
superstrings
compactified
on
a
Calabi-Yau
(CY)
three-fold.
Inflaton
is
identified
with
axion
of
the
Universal
Hypermultiplet
(UH).
The
other
UH
scalars
(including
dilaton)
are
stabilized
by
the
CY
fluxes
whose
impact
can
be
described
by
gauging
of
the
abelian
isometry
associated
with
the
axion,
when
the
NS5-brane
instanton
contributions
are
suppressed.
Then
the
stabilizing
scalar
potential
is
controlled
by
the
integrable
three-dimensional
Toda
equation,
and
leads
to
spontaneous
N=2
SUSY
breaking.
The
inflationary
scalar
potential
of
the
UH
axion
is
dynamically
generated
at
a
lower
scale
in
the
natural
inflation
via
the
non-perturbative
quantum
field
effects
such
as
gaugino
condensation.
The
natural
inflation
has
two
scales
that
allow
any
values
of
the
CMB
observables
$(n_s,r)$.
