lectures
on
complex
structures
\\
These
lecture
notes
give
an
introduction
to
a
number
of
ideas
and
methods
that
have
been
useful
in
the
study
of
complex
systems
ranging
from
spin
glasses
to
D-branes
on
Calabi-Yau
manifolds.
Topics
include
the
replica
formalism,
Parisi's
solution
of
the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model,
overlap
order
parameters,
supersymmetric
quantum
mechanics,
D-brane
landscapes
and
their
black
hole
duals.
