Classical
and
quantum
mechanics
of
the
nonrelativistic
Snyder
model
\\
The
Snyder
model
is
an
example
of
noncommutative
spacetime
admitting
a
fundamental
length
scale
$\beta$
and
invariant
under
Lorentz
transformations,
that
can
be
interpreted
as
a
realization
of
the
doubly
special
relativity
axioms.
Here,
we
consider
its
nonrelativistic
counterpart,
i.e.
the
Snyder
model
restricted
to
three-dimensional
Euclidean
space.
We
discuss
the
classical
and
the
quantum
mechanics
of
a
free
particle
in
this
framework,
and
show
that
they
strongly
depend
on
the
sign
of
a
coupling
constant
$\lambda$,
appearing
in
the
fundamental
commutators
and
proportional
to
$\beta^2$.
For
example,
if
$\lambda$
is
negative,
momenta
are
bounded.
On
the
contrary,
for
positive
$\lambda$,
positions
and
areas
are
quantized.
We
also
give
the
exact
solution
of
the
harmonic
oscillator
equations
both
in
the
classical
and
the
quantum
case,
and
show
that
its
frequency
is
energy
dependent.
