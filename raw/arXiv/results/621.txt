Strong
coupling
isotropization
of
non-Abelian
plasmas
simplified
\\
We
study
the
isotropization
of
a
homogeneous,
strongly
coupled,
non-Abelian
plasma
by
means
of
its
gravity
dual.
We
compare
the
time
evolution
of
a
large
number
of
initially
anisotropic
states
as
determined,
on
the
one
hand,
by
the
full
non-linear
Einstein's
equations
and,
on
the
other,
by
the
Einstein's
equations
linearized
around
the
final
equilibrium
state.
The
linear
approximation
works
remarkably
well
even
for
states
that
exhibit
large
anisotropies.
For
example,
it
predicts
with
a
20%
accuracy
the
isotropization
time,
which
is
of
the
order
of
t_iso
\lesssim
1/T,
with
T
the
final
equilibrium
temperature.
We
comment
on
possible
extensions
to
less
symmetric
situations.
