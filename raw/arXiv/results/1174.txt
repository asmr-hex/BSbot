Non-local
symmetries
for
Yang-Mills
theories
and
their
massive
counterparts
in
two
and
three
dimensions
\\
We
identify
a
non-local
symmetry
for
Yang-Mills
theories
in
1+1
and
2+1
spacetime
dimensions.
The
symmetry
mixes
a
vector
current
with
the
gauge
field.
The
current
involved
in
the
symmetry
is
required
to
satisfy
certain
constraints.
The
explicit
solution
for
the
current
obeying
these
constraints,
is
obtained
in
two
spacetime
dimensions
and
in
the
abelian
case
in
three
dimensions.
We
conjecture
that
the
current
is
generated
from
a
non-local
gauge
and
Lorentz
invariant
mass
term
in
three
dimensions
and
provide
some
evidence
for
it.
