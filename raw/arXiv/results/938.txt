Classical
versions
of
the
Big
Bang
cosmological
models
of
the
universe
contain
a
singularity
at
the
start
of
time,
hence
the
time
variable
in
the
field
equations
should
run
over
a
half-line.
Nonlocal
string
field
theory
equations
with
infinite
number
of
derivatives
are
considered
and
an
important
difference
between
nonlocal
operators
on
the
whole
real
line
and
on
a
half-line
is
pointed
out.
