Fisher
Equation
for
a
Decaying
Brane
\\
We
consider
the
inhomogeneous
decay
of
an
unstable
D-brane.
The
dynamical
equation
that
describes
this
process
(in
light-cone
time)
is
a
variant
of
the
non-linear
reaction-diffusion
equation
that
first
made
its
appearance
in
the
pioneering
work
of
(Luther
and)
Fisher
and
appears
in
a
variety
of
natural
phenomena.
