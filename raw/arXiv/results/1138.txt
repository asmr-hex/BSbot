A
note
on
the
integral
equation
for
the
Wilson
loop
in
N
=
2
D=4
superconformal
Yang-Mills
theory
\\
We
propose
an
alternative
method
to
study
the
saddle
point
equation
in
the
strong
coupling
limit
for
the
Wilson
loop
in
$\mathcal{N}=2$
D=4
super
Yang-Mills
with
an
SU(N)
gauge
group
and
2N
hypermultiplets.
This
method
is
based
on
an
approximation
of
the
integral
equation
kernel
which
allows
to
solve
the
simplified
problem
exactly.
To
determine
the
accuracy
of
this
approximation,
we
compare
our
results
to
those
obtained
recently
by
Passerini
and
Zarembo.
Although
less
precise,
this
simpler
approach
provides
an
explicit
expression
for
the
density
of
eigenvalues
that
is
used
to
derive
the
planar
free
energy.
