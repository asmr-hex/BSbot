On
the
supersymmetrization
of
inflation
in
f(R)
gravity
\\
An
N=1
Poincare
supergravity
action,
suitable
for
describing
the
Starobinsky
inflation,
is
proposed.
It
extends
f(R)
gravity
to
supergravity
in
its
old-minimal
version.
The
action
is
parametrized
by
a
single
holomorphic
potential
and
a
single
non-holomorphic
potential,
and
can
be
dualized
into
the
standard
matter-coupled
supergravity
action,
with
the
"matter"
given
by
two
chiral
superfields.
The
action
extends
the
earlier
proposals
for
embedding
the
Starobinsky
inflation
into
supergravity,
and
can
be
further
generalized
to
include
quantum
corrections
to
the
inflation.
Our
approach
assumes
the
gravitational
origin
of
inflaton
and
quintessence
in
the
context
of
supergravity,
by
using
a
single
chiral
scalar
curvature
superfield.
