Composite
particle
hydrodynamics
from
dyonic
black
branes
\\
We
construct
an
effective
hydrodynamics
of
composite
particles
in
(2+1)
dimensions
carrying
magnetic
flux,
employing
a
holographic
approach.
The
hydrodynamics
is
obtained
by
perturbation
of
the
dyonic
black
brane
solutions
in
the
derivative
expansion.
We
introduce
a
consistent
way
to
avoid
mixing
of
different
orders
in
the
expansion.
Thanks
to
this
method,
it
is
possible
to
take
the
strong
external
magnetic
field
limit
in
the
dual
field
theory.
To
compare
our
result
with
the
composite
particle
system,
we
study
several
cases
which
correspond
to
special
solutions
of
Einstein's
equation
and
Maxwell's
equations.
