Non-Commutative
Geometry
in
Higher
Dimensional
Quantum
Hall
Effect
as
A-Class
Topological
Insulator
\\
We
clarify
relations
between
the
higher
dimensional
quantum
Hall
effect
and
A-class
topological
insulator.
In
particular,
we
elucidate
physical
implications
of
the
higher
dimensional
non-commutative
geometry
in
the
context
of
A-class
topological
insulator.
