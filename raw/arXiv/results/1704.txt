Cosmological
consequences
of
the
noncommutative
geometry
spectral
action
are
presented.
Neglecting
the
nonminimal
coupling
of
the
Higgs
field
to
the
curvature,
background
cosmology
remains
unchanged,
and
only
the
inhomogeneous
perturbations
will
evolve
differently
from
the
equivalent
classical
system.
However,
considering
the
nonminimal
coupling,
corrections
will
be
obtained
even
at
the
level
of
the
background
cosmologies.
Finally,
the
Higgs
field
may
act
as
an
inflaton
field,
due
to
its
nonminimal
coupling
with
geometry.
