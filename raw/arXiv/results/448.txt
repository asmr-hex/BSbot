Relativistic
Fluids,
Superfluids,
Solids
and
Supersolids
from
a
Coset
Construction
\\
We
provide
a
systematic
coset
construction
of
the
effective
field
theories
governing
the
low-energy
dynamics
of
relativistic
fluids
and
solids,
and
of
their
"super"
counterparts.
These
effective
theories
agree
with
those
previously
derived
via
different
techniques.
As
an
application
of
our
methods,
we
re-derive
the
Wess-Zumino
term
relevant
for
anomalous
charge-carrying
fluids
in
(1+1)
dimensions.
