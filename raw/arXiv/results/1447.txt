Three-point
correlation
functions
from
semiclassical
circular
strings
\\
The
strong-coupling
limit
of
three-point
correlation
functions
of
local
operators
can
be
analyzed
beyond
the
supergravity
regime
using
vertex
operators
representing
spinning
string
states.
When
two
of
the
vertex
operators
correspond
to
heavy
string
states
having
large
quantum
numbers,
while
the
third
operator
corresponds
to
a
light
state
with
fixed
charges,
the
correlator
can
be
computed
in
the
large
string
tension
limit
by
means
of
a
semiclassical
approximation.
We
study
the
case
when
the
heavy
string
states
are
circular
string
solutions
with
one
AdS_5
spin
and
three
different
angular
momenta
along
S^5,
for
several
choices
of
the
light
string
state.
