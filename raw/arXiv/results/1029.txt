Description
of
Relativistic
Spin
without
use
of
Grassmann
variables
and
the
Dirac
equation
\\
We
propose
a
relativistic
particle
model
without
Grassmann
variables
which,
being
canonically
quantized,
leads
to
the
Dirac
equation.
Both
$\Gamma$\,-matrices
and
the
relativistic
spin
tensor
are
produced
through
the
canonical
quantization
of
the
classical
variables
which
parametrize
the
properly
constructed
relativistic
spin
surface.
Although
there
is
no
mass-shell
constraint
in
our
model,
our
particle's
speed
cannot
exceed
the
speed
of
light.
The
classical
dynamics
of
the
model
is
in
correspondence
with
the
dynamics
of
mean
values
of
the
corresponding
operators
in
the
Dirac
theory.
In
particular,
the
position
variable
experiences
{\it
Zitterbewegung}
in
noninteracting
theory.
The
classical
equations
for
the
spin
tensor
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
Barut-Zanghi
model
of
a
spinning
particle.
