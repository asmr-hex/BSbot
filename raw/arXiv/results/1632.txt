Forbidden
Landscape
from
Holography
\\
We
present
a
class
of
field
configurations
that
are
forbidden
in
the
quantum
gravity
because
of
inconsistency
in
the
dual
field
theory
from
holography.
Scale
invariant
but
non-conformal
field
theories
are
impossible
in
(1+1)
dimension,
and
so
should
be
the
corresponding
gravity
dual.
In
particular,
the
"spontaneous
Lorentz
symmetry
breaking"
models
and
the
"ghost
condensation"
models,
which
are
well-studied
in
phenomenology
literatures,
are
forbidden
in
any
consistent
quantum
theories
of
gravity
in
(1+2)
dimension
since
they
predict
such
inconsistent
field
configurations.
