Spin
Non-commutativity
and
the
Three-Dimensional
Harmonic
Oscillator
\\
A
three-dimensional
harmonic
oscillator
with
spin
non-commutativity
in
the
phase
space
is
considered.
The
system
has
a
regular
symplectic
structure
and
by
using
supersymmetric
quantum
mechanics
techniques,
the
ground
state
is
calculated
exactly.
We
find
that
this
state
is
infinitely
degenerate
and
it
has
explicit
spontaneous
broken
symmetry.
Analyzing
the
Heisenberg
equations,
we
show
that
the
total
angular
momentum
is
conserved.
