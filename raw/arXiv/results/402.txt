gravity
doubly
coupled
to
matter:
theory
and
cosmological
implications
\\
A
ghost-free
theory
of
gravity
with
two
dynamical
metrics
both
coupled
to
matter
is
shown
to
be
consistent
and
viable.
Its
cosmological
implications
are
studied,
and
the
models,
in
particular
in
the
context
of
partially
massless
gravity,
are
found
to
explain
the
cosmic
acceleration
without
resorting
to
dark
energy.
