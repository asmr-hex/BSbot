Symmetries
of
N=4
supersymmetric
CP(n)
mechanics
\\
We
explicitly
constructed
the
generators
of
$SU(n+1)$
group
which
commute
with
the
supercharges
of
N=4
supersymmetric
$\mathbb{CP}^n$
mechanics
in
the
background
U(n)
gauge
fields.
The
corresponding
Hamiltonian
can
be
represented
as
a
direct
sum
of
two
Casimir
operators:
one
Casimir
operator
on
$SU(n+1)$
group
contains
our
bosonic
and
fermionic
coordinates
and
momenta,
while
the
second
one,
on
the
SU(1,n)
group,
is
constructed
from
isospin
degrees
of
freedom
only.
