A
brief
overview
of
quantum
field
theory
with
deformed
symmetries
and
their
relation
with
quantum
gravity
\\
In
this
letter
we
outline
some
reasons
for
considering
a
quantum
field
theory
symmetric
under
quantum
groups
and
we
sketch
some
results
obtained
with
collaborators
in
the
k-Poincare
framework.
We
deal
with
this
latter
as
a
toy
model
towards
an
effective
and
low-energy
theory
of
quantum
gravity,
the
new
physically
relevant
effects
of
which
are
Planck-scale
suppressed.
