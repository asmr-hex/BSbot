Invariant
Differential
Operators
for
Non-Compact
Lie
Groups:
the
Reduced
SU(4,4)
Multiplets
\\
In
the
present
paper
we
continue
the
project
of
systematic
construction
of
invariant
differential
operators
on
the
example
of
the
non-compact
algebras
$su(n,n)$.
Earlier
were
given
the
main
multiplets
of
indecomposable
elementary
representations
for
$n\leq
4$,
and
the
reduced
ones
for
$n=2,3$.
Here
we
give
all
reduced
multiplets
containing
physically
relevant
representations
including
the
minimal
ones
for
$n=4$.
Due
to
the
recently
established
parabolic
relations
the
results
are
valid
also
for
the
algebras
$sl(8,\mathbb{R})$
and
$su^*(8)$
with
suitably
chosen
maximal
parabolic
subalgebras.
