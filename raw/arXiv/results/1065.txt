Solving
Noether's
equations
for
gauge
invariant
local
Lagrangians
of
N
arbitrary
higher
even
spin
fields
\\
We
consider
systems
of
higher
spin
gauge
fields
that
are
described
by
a
free
field
Lagrangian
and
one
interaction
of
arbitrary
order
$N$
that
is
local
and
satisfies
abelian
gauge
invariance.
Such
"solitary"
interactions
are
derived
from
Noether
potentials
solving
the
Noether
equations.
They
are
constructed
using
a
free
conformal
field
theory
carried
by
the
same
flat
space
as
the
higher
spin
fields.
In
this
field
theory
we
consider
$N$-loop
functions
of
conserved,
conformally
covariant
currents,
they
are
UV
divergent.
The
residue
of
the
first
order
pole
in
the
dimensional
regularisation
approach
to
the
$N$-loop
function
is
a
local
differential
operator
and
is
free
of
anomalies,
so
that
current
conservation
and
conformal
covariance
is
maintained.
Applying
this
operator
to
the
higher
spin
fields,
the
Noether
potential
results.
We
study
the
cases
$N=2,
N=3$
and
N=4.
We
argue
that
our
N=3
vertex
for
any
number
of
derivatives
$\Delta$
is
identical
with
the
known
cubic
interaction.
