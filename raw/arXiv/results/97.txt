On
sinh-Gordon
Thermodynamic
Bethe
Ansatz
and
fermionic
basis
\\
We
review
the
construction
of
the
fermionic
basis
for
sinh-Gordon
model
and
investigate
numerically
the
ultra-violet
limit
of
the
one-point
functions.
We
then
compare
the
predictions
obtained
from
this
formalism
against
previously
established
results.
