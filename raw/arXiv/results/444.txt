The
dilaton
Wess-Zumino
action
in
higher
dimensions
\\
We
present
a
general
formula
for
the
Wess-Zumino
action
associated
with
the
Weyl
anomaly,
given
in
a
curved
background
for
any
even
number
of
dimensions.
The
result
is
obtained
by
considering
a
finite
Weyl
transformation
of
counterterms
in
dimensional
regularization.
