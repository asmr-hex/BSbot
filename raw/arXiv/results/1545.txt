Singular
gauge
transformations
in
string
field
theory
\\
We
show
that
the
existence
of
a
tachyon
vacuum
puts
tight
restrictions
on
the
form
of
solutions
to
the
equations
of
motion
of
string
field
theory.
In
particular,
we
demonstrate
that
every
solution
can
be
written
as
a
-
formal
-
gauge
transformation
of
the
tachyon
vacuum.
In
order
for
a
solution
to
be
non-trivial,
this
gauge
transformation
must
be
singular
and
we
argue
that
this
will
happen
when
the
gauge
transformation
annihilates
a
projector
of
the
star-algebra.
We
comment
on
possible
applications
of
the
formalism
to
finding
new
solutions.
