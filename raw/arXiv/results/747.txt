Lectures
on
Mirror
Symmetry
and
Topological
String
Theory
\\
These
are
notes
of
a
series
of
lectures
on
mirror
symmetry
and
topological
string
theory
given
at
the
Mathematical
Sciences
Center
at
Tsinghua
University.
The
N=2
superconformal
algebra,
its
deformations
and
its
chiral
ring
are
reviewed.
A
topological
field
theory
can
be
constructed
whose
observables
are
only
the
elements
of
the
chiral
ring.
When
coupled
to
gravity,
this
leads
to
topological
string
theory.
The
identification
of
the
topological
string
A-
and
B-models
by
mirror
symmetry
leads
to
surprising
connections
in
mathematics
and
provides
tools
for
exact
computations
as
well
as
new
insights
in
physics.
A
recursive
construction
of
the
higher
genus
amplitudes
of
topological
string
theory
expressed
as
polynomials
is
reviewed.
