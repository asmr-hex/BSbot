Supersymmetric
non-Abelian
multiwaves
in
D=3
AdS
superspace
\\
We
present
a
covariant,
supersymmetric
and
kappa-symmetric
action
for
non-Abelian
multiwave
system
(nAmW)
in
D=3
AdS
superspace.
Its
flat
superspace
limit
provides
a
simplest
counterpart
of
the
recently
proposed
action
for
11
dimensional
system
of
N
nearly
coincident
M-waves
(multiple
M0-branes),
which
is
presently
known
for
the
case
of
flat
target
superspace
only.
