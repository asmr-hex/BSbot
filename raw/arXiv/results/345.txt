Black
Hole
Monodromy
and
Conformal
Field
Theory
\\
The
analytic
structure
of
solutions
to
the
Klein-Gordon
equation
in
a
black
hole
background,
as
represented
by
monodromy
data,
is
intimately
related
to
black
hole
thermodynamics.
It
encodes
the
"hidden
conformal
symmetry"
of
a
non-extremal
black
hole,
and
it
explains
why
features
of
the
inner
event
horizon
appear
in
scattering
data
such
as
greybody
factors.
This
indicates
that
hidden
conformal
symmetry
is
generic
within
a
universality
class
of
black
holes.
