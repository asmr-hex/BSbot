On
S-duality
of
5d
super
Yang-Mills
on
S^1
\\
We
study
a
duality
of
5d
maximally
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills
on
S^1,
which
exchanges
the
tower
of
Kaluza-Klein
W-bosons
and
the
tower
of
instantonic
monopoles.
This
duality
maps
a
non-simply-laced
gauge
theory
to
a
simply-laced
gauge
theory
twisted
by
an
outer
automorphism
around
S^1,
and
is
closely
related
to
the
Langlands
dual
of
affine
Lie
algebras.
