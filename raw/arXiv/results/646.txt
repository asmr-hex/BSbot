On
the
Geometry
of
Null
Polygons
in
Full
N=4
Superspace
\\
We
discuss
various
formulations
of
null
polygons
in
full,
non-chiral
N=4
superspace
in
terms
of
spacetime,
spinor
and
twistor
variables.
We
also
note
that
null
polygons
are
necessarily
fat
along
fermionic
directions,
a
curious
fact
which
is
compensated
by
suitable
equivalence
relations
in
physical
theories
on
this
superspace.
