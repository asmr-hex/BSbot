On
the
Vainshtein
mechanism
in
the
minimal
model
of
massive
gravity
\\
We
reinvestigate
the
fate
of
the
Vainhstein
mechanism
in
the
minimal
model
of
dRGT
massive
gravity.
As
the
latter
is
characterised
by
the
complete
absence
of
interactions
in
the
decoupling
limit,
we
study
their
structure
at
higher
energies.
We
show
that
in
static
spherically
symmetric
configurations,
the
lowest
energy
scale
of
interactions
is
pushed
up
to
the
Planck
mass.
This
fact
points
towards
an
absence
of
Vainshtein
mechanism
in
this
framework,
but
does
not
prove
it.
By
resorting
to
the
exact
vacuum
equations
of
motion,
we
show
that
there
is
indeed
an
obstruction
that
precludes
any
recovery
of
General
Relativity
under
the
conditions
of
stationarity
and
spherical
symmetry.
However,
we
argue
that
the
latter
are
too
restrictive
and
might
miss
some
important
physical
phenomena.
Indeed,
we
point
out
that
in
generic
non
spherically
symmetric
or
time-dependent
situations,
interactions
arising
at
energies
arbitrarily
close
to
the
energy
scale
of
the
decoupling
limit
reappear.
This
leads
us
to
question
whether
the
small
degree
of
spherical
symmetry
breaking
in
the
solar
system
can
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
successful
Vainshtein
mechanism.
