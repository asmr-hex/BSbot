Compact
F-theory
GUTs
with
U(1)_PQ
\\
We
construct
semi-local
and
global
realizations
of
SU(5)
GUTs
in
F-theory
that
utilize
a
U(1)_PQ
symmetry
to
protect
against
dimension
four
proton
decay.
Symmetries
of
this
type,
which
assign
charges
to
H_u
and
H_d
that
forbid
a
tree
level
\mu
term,
play
an
important
role
in
scenarios
for
neutrino
physics
and
gauge
mediation
that
have
been
proposed
in
local
F-theory
model
building.
As
demonstrated
in
