The
excitation
spectrum
of
rotating
strings
with

at
the
ends
\\
We
compute
the
spectrum
of
excitations
of
the
rotating
Nambu-Goto
string
with
masses
at
the
ends.
We
find
interesting
quasi-massless
modes
in
the
limit
of
slow
rotation
and
comment
on
the
nontrivial
relation
between
world-sheet
and
target
space
energy.
