This Directory contains all the scripts needed to generate false abstract data from snarXiv.

***Note, however, that you must have the OCaml compiler and standard libs installed on your
machine in order to run snarxiv.ml. If you don't, you can get it with "apt-get install ocaml"
on linux (only 100 MBs). ***

Simply run the "generateSnarXivData.py" script with the number of desired number of data points 
as the only argument to begin. Easy as pie!
