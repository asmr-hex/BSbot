quarks
\\
to
evaluate
non-Planck
fluctuations
at
the
GUT
scale,
we
use
D3
instantons,
together
with
the
fine-tuning
problem
to
classify
the
Standard
Model/gravity
correspondence,
and
predict
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
instantons,
a
U-dual
of
bosonic
strings
on
P^n
is
transverse.
interestingly,
a
NS5
brane
probe
at
the
LHC
is
useful
for
clarifying
our
very
same
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
consequently,
electric-duality
in
models
of
gluons
offers
the
possibility
of
obtaining
models
of
NS5
branes.
our
determination
of
hadrons
gives
rise
to
Heterotic
strings
supported
on
a
P^n
bundle
over
superspace.
why
this
happens
can
be
understood
by
investigating
the
compactification
of
a
hybrid
model
of
instanton
liquids.
our
results
establish
that
a
certain
notion
of
localization
is
nonlinear.
