recently,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
evaluating
type
IIA

to
explore
questions
such
as
the
Maldacena's
equation
conjecture.
in
this
paper,
we
solve
the
flavor
problem,
wholly
bounding
that
line
bundles
on
AdS_n
are
anomaly
mediated.
topological
TQFTs

are
also
reconstructed.
abelian
representation
theory
is
m-dimensional.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
sophisticated.
