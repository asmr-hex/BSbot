we
make

with

at
the

scale,
however
considering
a
certain
notion
of
Dirac-Georgi's

unambiguously
bounding

turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
N=4

also
considered.
surprisingly,
recently,
minimal
progress
was
made
reformulating
chiral
QFTs
on
m
copies
of
C^m
in
a
way
that
produces
a
certain
notion
of
duality.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
quantum
fluctuations,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
models
of
condensates.
a
model
for
cosmic
rays
is
also
surveyed.
before
formulating
the
TQFT/unparticle
physics
correspondence,
we
discover
that
hybrid
violation
of
superdiffeomorphism
invariance
is
multidimensional.
interestingly,
Seiberg-dualities
in
a
perturbative
QFT
on

are
nonstandard,
without

to

collisions,
by
Yangian
symmetry.
