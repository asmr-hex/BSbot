computations

N=4
TQFTs
deformed
by
local
F-terms
can
be
realized
from
the
Ising
Model.
unfortunately,
among
particle
physicists,
partial
progress
was
made
obtaining
bosonic
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
the
conformal
MSSM
is
also
explored.
next,
we
reconstruct
the
partition
function.
before
reconstructing
extremal
black
holes
at
the
intermediate
scale,
we
obtain
that,
in
the
approximation
that
a
clever
resolution
of
the
SUSY
CP
problem
lets
us
generalize
integrability
on
a
RS1
background,
explaining
type

fortunately,
clarifying
anomaly
mediation
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
