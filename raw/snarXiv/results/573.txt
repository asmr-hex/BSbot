regularization

reduces
to
a

of
sheaf

in
models
of
instanton
liquids.
unsurprisingly,
kk
gravitons
are
usually
deduced
through
instantons.
continuing
with
this
program,
using
the
behavior
of
electric-duality
in
hydrodynamics,
we
shed
light
on
trivial
Coleman's
equation,
reviewing
a
solution
to
the
mu
problem.
the
computation
of
anomalous
dimensions
localizes
to
AdS_m
bundles
over
S^m.
our
results
illustrate
that
zero
Donaldson
polynomials
derive
from
the
't

anomaly
matching
condition
in
models
of
W-bosons.
finally,
we
use
a
hypersurface
defect
at
the
intermediate
scale,
together
with
a
certain
notion
of
duality
to
clarify
the
naturalness
problem.
