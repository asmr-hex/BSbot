surprisingly,
among
mathematicians,
work
on
gravity
has
opened
up
a
unconventional
class
of
non-non-RS
models,
as
realized
in
localization
in
topological
strings
on
C^n.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
some
general
illustrations,
we
take
a
minimal
approach
to

after
considering
bubbles
at

we
find
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this

condensates
at

scale
are
inertial.
interestingly,

is
beyond
the

of
this
