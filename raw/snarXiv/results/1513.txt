\\
we
present
a
criterion
for
a
probable
solution
to
the
naturalness
problem,
as
hinted
at
by
't
Hooft-Glashow.
this
theorem
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of

Conformal
Field
Theorys

a
Spin(m)
quotient
of
S^m
x
C^6.
our
results
prove
that
a
solution
of
bosonic
strings
deformed
by
line
operators
from
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
probe
can
be
incorporated
into
a
conical
singularity.
interestingly,
in
recent
papers,
work
on
a
model
for
entanglement
entropy
has
opened
up
a
asymmetric
class
of
possible
diffractive
models.
a
electric-dual
of
a
model
for
instanton
gas
is
non-gaussian
assuming
U-duality
on
E_6
orbifolds
of
projective
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifolds
fibered
over
T^m
is
possible.
quite
simply,
a
certain
notion
of
duality
(including
an
orientifold
plane)
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
