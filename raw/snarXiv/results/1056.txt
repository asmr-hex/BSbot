among
mathematicians,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
anomaly
mediation.
we
solve
the
naturalness
problem,
and
calculate
that,
as
revealed
by
anomaly
matching,
D2
instantons
are
momentum-dependent.
n-dimensional
unparticle
physics
near
an
instanton
is
also
recalled.
our
results
determine
that
dimensionality
is
exactly-soluble.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
intricate.
