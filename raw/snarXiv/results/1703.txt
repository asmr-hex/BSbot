the
formulation
of
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
in
a
non-gaussian
model
with
Higgss
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
evaluating
U-duality
in
parent
gauge
mediation
(excluding
a
analytic
continuation
of
unitarity
in
QCD
compactified
on
the
moduli
space
of
projective
Hirzebruch
surfaces).
unfortunately,
some
work
has
been
done
in
recent
years
analyzing
topological
strings
.
we
take
a
unified
approach.
we
also
obtain
agreement
with
amplitudes.
this
correspondence
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
T-duality
in
primordial
inflation.
our
results
establish
that
electrons
are
perturbative.
