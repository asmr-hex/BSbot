\\
the
quantum
gravitational
Hilbert
space
is
consistent.
unfortunately,
the
low-scale
A-model
is
usually
predicted
from
a
E_7
singularity.

made
easier
by
solving
the
anthropic
limit.
why
this
happens
can
be
explored
by

before

leptons,
we
conjecture
that,
in
the
limit
that
a
reduction
of
equivariant
structure
in
M-Theory
deformed
by
quasi-primary
D-terms
is
modified,
instantons

are

the
rest
for

study.
