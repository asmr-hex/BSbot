F-Theory
far
from
hyperplane
defects
\\
among
mathematicians,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
reformulating
a
topologically
twisted
QFT
on
Spin(9)
orbifolds
of
RS1
backgrounds.
we
investigate
some
conspicuous
cases.
a
exclusive
model
with
neutrinos
is
also
analyzed.
when
generalizing
bounding
models
of
kk
gravitons,
we
deduce
that,
in
the
equivariant
structure
case,
axions
are
supergravity
mediated,
with
the
help
of
a
certain
notion
of
integrability.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
extending
the
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
type
IIB
strings
.
