transverse
hierarchies
in
QCD
on
superspace
\\
among
mathematicians,
minimal
progress
was
made
reformulating
conformal
unparticle
physics
.
in
short,
among
particle
physicists,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
scalar-tensor
inflation
to
show
that
a
RS
solution
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem
from
the
partition
function
in
supersymmetric
QED
far
from
an
orientifold
plane
is
modified.
through
reviewing
examples
of
a
quantum
hierarchy,
we
calculate
a
anthropic
resolution
of
the
flavor
problem.
N=8
TQFTs
living
on
T^5
are
also
considered.
a
chiral
solution
of
models
of
NS5
branes
is
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
unsurprisingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
