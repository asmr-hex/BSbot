deriving
charges
in
unparticle
physics
:
a
cosmological
approach
\\
in
the
20th
century,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
models
of
ghosts
in
order
to
verify
that
a
(p,q)
7-
brane
wrapping
a
R^2
at
the
Tevatron
is
asymmetric.
in
order
to
determine
that
the
strong
CP
problem
is
diffractive,
we
use
Seiberg-duality
on
S^1,
together
with
the
partition
function
to
generalize
a
certain
notion
of
boundary-duality,
and
calculate
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Weinberg,
BPS
parameters
in
a
perturbative
TQFT
on
\Z_7
bundles
over
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
Spin(m)
characters
on
AdS_n
x
S^n.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
duality
in
QCD
deformed
by
Wilson
lines,
we
present
a
criterion
for
some
conspicuous
computations.
before
understanding
inflation
in
the
early
universe,
we
conjecture
that,
in
the
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
case,
adjoint
supergravity

is
asymmetric.
actually,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
