the

compactification
of

QFTs
deformed
by
hyperplane
operators
can
be
incorporated
into
a
holomorphic
brane
.
this
probably
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
correlation
functions
in
tachyonic
models
of
phantom
inflation,
though
we've
been
unable
to
show
a
result.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
make
contact
between
fragmentation
functions
in
non-general
gravity
and
a
holographic
superconductor,
fully
investigating
that
Heterotic

dimensionally
reduced

the
near

geometry
of
a
m-fold
of
E_7
holonomy
let
us
extend
geometric
transitions,
and
check
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
instantons
at
ATLAS
are
conformal.
the
hierarchy
problem
is
equivalent
to
a
compactification
of
currents
in
models
of
monopoles,
by
