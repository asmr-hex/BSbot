\\
U-duality

theories

lets
us
formulate
the
low-scale
O(n)
Model
(involving
dark
matter
during
inflation).
the
calculation
of
anomalous
dimensions
localizes
to
linear
dilaton
backgrounds.
why
this
happens
can
be
generalized
by
considering
orientifold
planes
at
the
GUT
scale.
after
reviewing
anomaly
constraints
in
a
n-dimensional
Conformal
Field
Theory
surrounded
by
C_n
singularities,
we
deduce
that
hyperplane
defects
are
alternative.
however,
our
results
establish
that
orientifold
planes
are
linear.
