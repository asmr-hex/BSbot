extending

near
a

produces
a
crucial
framework
for
exploring
hyperkahler
quotients
on
ALF
superspace.
we
take
a
quantum

approach.
we
take
a
planar
approach.
F-Theory
supported
on
T^m
is
also
explained.
we
take
a
minimal
approach.
hypersurface
defects
are
related
to
examples
of
renormalization.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
