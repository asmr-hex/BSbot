Geometric
Langlands-dualities
on
Sp(n)
orbifolds
of
ALE
fibrations
are
gauge
mediated
\\
among
particle
physicists,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
a
model
of
NS5
branes
in
a
way
that
produces
instanton
liquids
at
the
intermediate
scale.
in
this
paper,
we
establish
a
surprising
correspondence
between
Feynman
diagrams
in
String
theories
on
P^8
and
kk
gravitons.
a
holographic
superconductor
is
also
constructed.
when
reviewing
the
QCD/MSSM
correspondence,
we
derive
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
the
extension
of
hyperkahler
quotients
in
perturbative
QCD
compactified
on
moduli
spaces
of
moduli
spaces
of
moduli
spaces
of
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
fibered
over
C^m
is
transverse,
as
revealed
by
anomaly
matching.
