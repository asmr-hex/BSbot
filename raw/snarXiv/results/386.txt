in
recent
years,
work
on
models
of
entanglement
entropy
has
opened
up
a
thermodynamic
class
of
non-inflationary
models.
in
order
to
avoid
classifying
noncommutative
branes
,
we
take
a
alternative
approach
to
black
branes

during
inflation.
a
small
black
hole
during
inflation
can
be
deduced
from
superconformal
symmetry
breaking
in
unparticle
physics
assuming
spacetime
foam
at
the
LHC
is
holographic.
our
results
establish
that
localization
depends
on
a
extremal
black
hole
at
the
Planck
scale.
