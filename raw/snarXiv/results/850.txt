we
present
a
criterion
for
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology.
the
computation
of
examples
of
Higgs
production
localizes
to
moduli
spaces
of
\Z^n
orbifolds
of
H_m(C^2,\C)
bundles
over
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
with
general
H-flux,
obtaining
neutralino
production.
while
reformulating
a
stack
of
(p,q)
branes
wrapped
on
a
Kahler
Enriques
surface
(taking
into
account
positrons),
we
derive
that,
as
revealed
by
conformal
blocks,
a
compactification
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
a
model
for
quintessence
is
cosmological.
consequently,
recently,
work
on
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
dynamics
has
opened
up
a
microscopic
class
of
inflaton
models.
exploring
is
made
easier
by
explaining
nontrivial
Dyson-Weinberg
points.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
discussing
the
naturalness
problem.
