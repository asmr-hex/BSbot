in
equivariant
chaos
\\
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
among
particle
physicists
on
quantum
gravitational
RS1.
we
take
a
8-dimensional
approach.
we
take
a
primary
inflationary
approach
to
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
(including
the
reduction
of
non-high-scale
models
with
axions).
next,
we
investigate
a
massive
black
hole.
when
constructing
equivariant
structures
on
dS_n,
we
deduce
that
inflationary
models

are
supersymmetric.
