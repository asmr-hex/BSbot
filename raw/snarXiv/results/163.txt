\\
in
recent
papers,
work
on
models
of
holomorphic
branes
has
opened
up
a
supergravity
mediated
class
of
Coleman
models.
we
make
contact
with
some
particular
illustrations,
unfortunately
surveying
the
solution
of
bosonic
strings
on
m
copies
of
CY_m,
and
check
that
partition
functions
in
quantum
QED
are
perturbative.
we
take
a
modified
approach.
our
results
determine
that
nonzero
structures
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
the
null
future
of
dS_m
are
useful
for
studying
black
branes
.
