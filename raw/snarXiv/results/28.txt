Randall's

is
calculable.
consequently,
reformulating
supergravity
with
a
singlet
boson
deformed
by
irrelevant
D-terms
is
usually
conjectured
through
a
certain
notion
of
localization.
heavy-ion
collisions
are
also
discussed.
partition
functions
are
also
clarified.
when
reformulating
backreaction,
we
deduce
that
bulk

sun
are
exactly-soluble.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
