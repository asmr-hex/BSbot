a
gravitational
approach

quotients

also
explained.
while
reformulating
models
of
hadrons,
we
deduce
that,
in
the
limit
that
models
of
Higgss
follow
from
trivial
Silverstein-Maxwell's
equation,
some
little-known
illustrations
can
be
brought
to

a

of
work
has
been
done
in

we
therefore
disagree
with
a
result
of

Heterotic

we
hope
this

provides
a
good
starting
point
for
reconstructing
hyperplane
defects.
