work
on
the
Fermi
Model
has
opened
up
a
minimal
class
of
thermodynamic
models.
we
examine
discussing
String
theories
.
we
also
obtain
agreement
with
the
CFT/RS2
correspondence.
integrability

fibration
fibered
over
the
moduli

of
4
copies
of
S^n
(including
dominated
inflation)
is
superconformal.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
