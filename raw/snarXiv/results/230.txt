7-
branes
wrapped
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
Minkowskian
linear
dilaton
background
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$
are
related
to
kaons.
this
probably
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
the
Poincare
algebra
in
Horava
thermodynamics,
though
we've
been
unable
to
demonstrate
a
correspondence.
the
monopole
charge
is
also
evaluated.
before
reconstructing
examples
of
alternative
sectors
in
models
of
entropy,
we
obtain
that,
in
the
nontrivial
structure
case,
a
certain
notion
of
magnetic-duality
is
modified.
