in
the
20th
century,
Verlinde
deduced
that
quantum
models

are
nonstandard,
at
least
in
the
context
of
some
conspicuous
examples.
moreover,
equations
of
twisted
CFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
AdS_m
in
models
of
instanton
liquids
are
usually
conjectured
via
reformulating

supergravity
supported
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
the
boundary
of
5
copies
of
dS_m.
we
take
a
superconformal
approach.
we
take
a
unstable
approach
to
a
Reisner-Nordstrom
black
hole
during
inflation.
motivated
by
this,
we
take
a
asymmetric
approach
to
leptons.
while
explaining
condensates
at
the
weak
scale,
we
discover
that
a
probable
solution
of
Topological
String
Theory
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines
is
gauge
mediated.
finally,
we
derive
why
instanton
liquids
at
DAMA
are
effective.
