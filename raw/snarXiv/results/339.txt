the
QFT/general
relativity
correspondence
produces
a
elaborate
framework
for
formulating
quintessence
at
the
Planck
scale.
however,
some
work
has
been
done
recently
classifying
Heterotic
string
theory
.
in
this
paper,
we
discuss
anomaly
matching
on
a
n-fold
with
general
B-field,
thoroughly
ultimately
reformulating
that
a
certain
notion
of
discrete
structure
is
the
low-scale
limit
in
superconformal
QED
living
on
T^m.
a
stack
of
A-type
branes
wrapped
on
a
E_7
orbifold
of
fuzzy
de
Sitter
Space
at
the
Tevatron
led
to
a
complicated
theorem:
the
extension
of
thermodynamics
is
related
to
the
confinement
problem.
our
results
prove
that
a
formulation
of
Nahm's
equations
in
a
anomaly
mediated
model
with
ghosts
is
the
final
component
in
reformulating
quintessence
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
