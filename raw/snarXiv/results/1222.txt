reconstructing
instantons
at
SNO:
M-Theory

\\
the
reduction
of
Planck
models
of
inconsistent
fluctuations
can
be
incorporated
into
the
A-model/general
relativity
correspondence.
Heterotic
string
theory

is
also
constructed.
we
take
a
microscopic
approach.
after
exploring
neutralinos,
we
check
that,
by
symmetry,
longitudinal
amplitudes
in
twisted
CFTs

reduce
to
the
thermodynamics/RS2
correspondence.
