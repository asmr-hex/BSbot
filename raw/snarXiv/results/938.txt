why
Virosoro
algebras
are
thermodynamic
\\
via
formulating
Nahm's
equations,
we
examine
the
QFT/S^n
correspondence.
a
elaborate
part
of
this
analysis
lets
us
explain
orientifold
planes
at
SNO.
fortunately,
PDFs
in
QCD
with
triplet
n-forms

are
usually
conjectured
from
a
reduction
of
integration
cycles
in
Heterotic
strings
supported
on
a
E_7
quotient
of
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
the
near

geometry
of
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
T^4.
this
gives
rise
to
an
extremely
precise
check
of
a
holographic
superconductor.
interestingly,
instanton
liquids
in
the
early
universe
are
acoustic.
before
considering
a

CFTs
,
we
deduce
that,
by

a
B-type

probe
at
the
Tevatron
is
unstable.
