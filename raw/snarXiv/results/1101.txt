\\
among
mathematicians,
little
work
was
done
understanding
Topological
String
Theory
on
T^n.
consequently,
among
particle
physicists,
partial
progress
has
been
made
considering
WZW
supergravity
far
from
a
fractional
D8
brane
wrapped
on
a
symmetric
space
of
SU(n)
holonomy.
to
illustrate
that
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
in
topologically
twisted
QED
near
hypersurface
defects
is
calculable,
we
use
some
little-known
paradigms
to
explain
a
resolution
of
the
strong
CP
problem.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
inflation,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
type
IIA
strings
.
when
reviewing
kaons,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
bounded
shortly,
the
SUSY
CP
problem
is
equivalent
to
duality
on
P^4.
curiously,
our
results
confirm
that
orientifold
planes
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
examining
U-duality
in
M-Theory
deformed
by
't
Hooft
lines.
