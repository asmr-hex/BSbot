approaches
to
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
\\
in
recent
papers,
Klebanov
calculated
that
the
mu
problem
(excluding
supersymmetric
QFTs
dimensionally
reduced
on
noncommutative
Taub-NUT
Space)
is
unconventional.
we
establish
that
some
specific
examples
can
be
discovered
from
the
simple
formulation
of
models
of
bubble
nucleation.
in
this
conjecture,
the
S-dual
of
type
IIB
compactified
on
moduli
spaces
of
H^n(R^7,\C)
quotients
of
affine
bundles
over
n
copies
of
dS_m
makes
a
arresting
appearance.
E_7
singularities
at
the
Tevatron
are
alternative,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
