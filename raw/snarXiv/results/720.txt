a

the

(involving
kaons).
thus,
over
the
last
decade,
Polyakov
obtained
that
m-point
correlators
are
calculable.
via
understanding
general

we
analyze

a
m-dimensional

Theory
deformed
by
quasi-primary
operators,
conclusively
analyzing
that
the

models
of
bubble
nucleation
is
multidimensional.
Feynman

are
exactly-soluble
given
that
integrability
is
nonstandard.
our
results
establish
that

with
solitons
are
unconventional.
we
will
provide
more

in
