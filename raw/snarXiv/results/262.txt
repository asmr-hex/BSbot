therefore,
among
mathematicians,
Hitchin
derived
that
canonical
co-isotropic
instantons
at
the
LHC
are
perturbative.
thus,
the

can
be
calculated
from

this
conjecture
has
long
been
understood
in

of
geometric

our
results
confirm
that
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
wrapped
on
a
Riemann

of
\Z^n
holonomy
at
the
LHC
are
useful
for
explaining
quantum

our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Nelson.
