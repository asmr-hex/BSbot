why
charginos
are
supersymmetric
\\
some
specific
cases
are
general.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
dark
matter,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
Gromov-Witten
invariants
on
RS1
backgrounds
of
E_8
holonomy.
the
representation
theory
depends,
consequently,
on
whether
instantons
at
the
GUT
scale
are
asymmetric.
divisors
on
R^5
are
2-dimensional.
