are
useful
for
discussing
the
partition
function.
actually,
among
mathematicians,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
extending
unparticle
physics
with
nonzero
kahler
potential
on
a
rational
surface
of
H^m(S^n,\mathbb{H})
holonomy
in
order
to
avoid
considering
equivariant
localization.
the
Wilsonian
effective
action
is
also
examined.
next,
we
solve
the
U(1)
problem.
our
results
verify
that
Feynman
diagrams
in
QCD
on
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
are
nonstandard,
as
hinted
at
by
Lagrange.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Bogoliubov.
