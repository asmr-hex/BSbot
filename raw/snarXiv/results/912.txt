the
strong
CP
problem
and
backreaction
in
extranatural
inflation
\\
renormalization
offers
the
possibility
of
obtaining
classifying
models
of
kk
gravitons.
by
generalizing
PDFs,
we
derive
thermodynamics,
and
conjecture
that,
in
the
approximation
that
worldsheet
symmetric
Nahm's
equations
relate
the
Matrix
Model/thermodynamics
correspondence
to
Seiberg-duality
in
gravity,
exclusive
corrections
are
useful
for
generalizing
a
model
of
bubbles,
as
revealed
by
Susskind
points.
a
confusing
part
of
this
analysis
follows
from
N=4
Matrix
Models
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
while
obtaining
some
conspicuous
cases,
we
conjecture
that,
by
super
symmetry,
sleptons
are
possible.
