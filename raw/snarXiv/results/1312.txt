recently,
partial
progress
was
made
discussing
a

over
P^m

from

at
least
in
the
context
of
Hitchin
mechanics.
continuing
with
this
program,

we
solve

we

illustrate
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
the
Silverstein-Coleman
formalism
and
Toda
supergravity
deformed
by
relevant
D-terms.
after
surveying
the
QED/QCD
correspondence,
we
discover
that
electrons
are
nonlocal.
