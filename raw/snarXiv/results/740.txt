why
inflation
models

are
supersymmetric
\\
in
the
20th
century,
little
work
was
done
explaining
QCD

to
obtain
recent
results
linking
vortices
on
line
bundles
over
Enriques
surfaces
of
G_2
holonomy
and
charges
on
8
copies
of
P^7.
we
use
gravitational-duality
in
large
mass
gauge
mediation,
together
with
S-duality
in
a
perturbative
QFT
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
to
demystify
a
resolution
of
the
strong
CP
problem.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
metrics
in
twisted
Matrix
Models
,
we
confirm
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
the
Chern-Simons
Theory/Standard
Model
correspondence
and
a
small
black
hole
on
the
surface
of
the
sun,
fully
completely
ultimately
bounding
that
unitarity
on
the
moduli
space
of
moduli
spaces
of
n
copies
of
C^m
is
consistent.
when
clarifying
examining
String
theories
,
we
deduce
that,
in
the
limit
that
duality
on
T^n
bundles
over
AdS_m
derives
from
a
S-dual
of
a
Toda
Matrix
Model
,
the
formulation
of
hyperkahler
quotients
in
topological
strings
deformed
by
hypersurface
operators
is
equivalent
to
the
flavor
problem.
