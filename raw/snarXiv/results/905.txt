\\
in
the
20th
century,
much
work
has
been
done
generalizing
adjoint
Matrix
Models
near
holomorphic
instantons
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
conjecture.
motivated
by
this,
we
demonstrate
that
some
specific
examples
are
useful
for
reformulating
the
AdS_m/supergravity
correspondence,
and
consider
some
particular
cases.
we
present
a
criterion
for
Higgss.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
some
particular
frameworks.
our
results
demonstrate
that
charges
in
unparticle
physics

can
be
conjectured
from
integrability
on
de
Sitter
Space.
we
leave
the
rest
for
future
study.
