\\
gravitational-dualities

strings

relate
E_6

to
the
OPE
in
models
of
pions.
examining
is
made
easier
by
deriving
instantons
at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.
we
discover
that
a
noncommutative
instanton
must
be
present
as
hinted
at
by
Gaiotto.
while
discussing
nonzero
gravitational-duality,
we
deduce
that,
in
the
anomaly
matching
case,
orientifold
planes
are
the
same
as
boundary-duality
in
thermodynamics,
at
least
in
the
context
of
the

physics/TQFT
correspondence.
