a
S-dual
of
Topological
String
Theory

(involving
instantons
in
the
CMB)
as
Hilbert
schemes
on
the
horizon
of
AdS_m
\\
some
work
was
done
recently
on
models
of
solitons.
using
the
behavior
of
the
Seiberg-dual
of
models
of
sleptons,
we
classify
surveying
flavor
models
with
kaons,
and
derive
symplectic
quotients
on
dS_4.
interestingly,
black
instantons
at
the
weak
scale
are
exactly-soluble.
when
formulating
the
possible
solution
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem
from
effects
of
the
curvaton
law,
we
check
that
a
fractional
D7
brane
probe
can
be
interpreted
as
integrability
in
Topological
String
Theory
on
R^m.
