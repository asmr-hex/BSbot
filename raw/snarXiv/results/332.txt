instantons
in
the
CMB
\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
the
O(n)
Model
has
opened
up
a
chiral
class
of
momentum-dependent
models.
unfortunately,
line
defects
at
DAMA
are
usually
obtained
via
(p,q)
7-
branes
wrapping
a
R^7.
we
take
a
effective
approach
to
orientifold
planes.
models
of
instanton
gas
are
also
clarified.
our
results
demonstrate
that
abelian
Klebanov
points
are
perturbative.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Gubser.
