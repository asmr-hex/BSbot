solving
models
of
Higgss:
a
gauge
mediated
approach
\\
we
bound
a
line
defect.
unfortunately,
a
certain
notion
of
dimensionality
lets
us
formulate
our
very
same
integrability.
when
classifying
the
QCD/TQFT
correspondence,
we
derive
that,
with
the
help
of
a
U-dual
of
String
theories
surrounded
by
a
orbifold
singularity,
conformal
models

are
microscopic.
consequently,
recently,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
on
flavor
models
with
kk
gravitons.
we
also
predict
agreement
with
Nekrosov
points
in
chiral
CFTs
deformed
by
loop
operators.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Randall.
