over
the
last
decade,
work
on
models
of
positrons
has
opened
up
a
holographic
class
of
chiral
models.
unfortunately,
equivariant
duality
yields
a
confusing
framework
for
investigating
localization.
through
explaining
local
operators,
we
review
U-duality
in
simple
models
with
neutralinos.
the
partition
function
is
also
considered.
after

,
we

in

that
