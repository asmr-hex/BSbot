therefore,
in
the
20th
century,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
general

to
demystify
recent
results
linking
nontrivial
integration
cycles
and
chaos
in
QED
with

lines.
a
unforseen
part
of
this
analysis
depends
on
anomaly
matching
on
S^2.
a
surprising
part
of
this
analysis
is
the
final
component
in
solving
the
formulation
of
line

in
bosonic

,
as
revealed
by

T-duality

equivalent
to
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
