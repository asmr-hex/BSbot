Three-dimensional
Lorentz-violating
action
\\
We
demonstrate
the
generation
of
the
three-dimensional
Chern-Simons-like
Lorentz-breaking
``mixed"
quadratic
action
via
an
appropriate
Lorentz-breaking
coupling
of
vector
and
scalar
fields
to
the
spinor
field
and
study
some
features
of
the
scalar
QED
with
such
a
term.
We
show
that
the
same
term
emerges
through
a
nonpertubative
method,
namely
the
Julia-Toulouse
approach
of
condensation
of
charges
and
defects.
