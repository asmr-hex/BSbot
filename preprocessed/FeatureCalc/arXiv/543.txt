Information
Erasure
in
Black
Hole
\\
We
analyze
the
Kim,
Lee
&amp;
Lee
model
of
information
erasure
by
black
holes
and
find
contradictions
with
standard
physical
laws.
We
demonstrate
that
the
erasure
model
leads
to
arbitrarily
fast
information
erasure;
the
proposed
physical
interpretation
of
information
freezing
at
the
event
horizon
as
observed
by
an
asymptotic
observer
is
problematic;
and
information
erasure,
whatever
the
process
may
be,
near
the
black
hole
horizon
leads
to
contradictions
with
quantum
mechanics
if
Landauer's
principle
is
assumed.
The
later
part
of
the
work
demonstrates
the
significance
of
the
"erasure
entropy."
We
show
that
the
erasure
entropy
is
the
mutual
information
between
two
subsystems.
