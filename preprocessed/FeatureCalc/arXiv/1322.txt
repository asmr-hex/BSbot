Triality
in
SU(2)
Seiberg-Witten
theory
and
Gauss
hypergeometric
function
\\
Through
AGT
conjecture,
we
show
how
triality
observed
in
\N=2
SU(2)
N_f=4
QCD
can
be
interpreted
geometrically
as
the
interplay
among
six
of
Kummer's
twenty-four
solutions
belonging
to
one
fixed
Riemann
scheme
in
the
context
of
hypergeometric
differential
equations.
We
also
stress
that
our
presentation
is
different
from
the
usual
crossing
symmetry
of
Liouville
conformal
blocks,
which
is
described
by
the
connection
coefficient
in
the
case
of
hypergeometric
functions.
Besides,
upon
solving
hypergeometric
differential
equations
at
the
zeroth
order
by
means
of
the
WKB
method,
a
curve
(thrice-punctured
Riemann
sphere)
emerges.
The
permutation
between
these
six
Kummer's
solutions
then
boils
down
to
the
outer
automorphism
of
the
associated
curve.
