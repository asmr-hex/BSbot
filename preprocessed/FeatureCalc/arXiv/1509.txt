Twistor
Theory
and
Differential
Equations
\\
This
is
an
elementary
and
self--contained
review
of
twistor
theory
as
a
geometric
tool
for
solving
non-linear
differential
equations.
Solutions
to
soliton
equations
like
KdV,
Tzitzeica,
integrable
chiral
model,
BPS
monopole
or
Sine-Gordon
arise
from
holomorphic
vector
bundles
over
$T\CP^1$.
A
different
framework
is
provided
for
the
dispersionless
analogues
of
soliton
equations,
like
dispersionless
KP
or
$SU(\infty)$
Toda
system
in
2+1
dimensions.
Their
solutions
correspond
to
deformations
of
(parts
of)
$T\CP^1$,
and
ultimately
to
Einstein--Weyl
curved
geometries
generalising
the
flat
Minkowski
space.
A
number
of
exercises
is
included
and
the
necessary
facts
about
vector
bundles
over
the
Riemann
sphere
are
summarised
in
the
Appendix.
