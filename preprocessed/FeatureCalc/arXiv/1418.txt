Determinants
and
conformal
anomalies
of
GJMS
operators
on
spheres
\\
The
conformal
anomalies
and
functional
determinants
of
the
Branson--GJMS
operators,
P_{2k},
on
the
d-dimensional
sphere
are
evaluated
in
explicit
terms
for
any
d
and
k
such
that
k
&lt;
d/2+1
(if
d
is
even).
The
determinants
are
given
in
terms
of
multiple
gamma
functions
and
a
rational
multiplicative
anomaly,
which
vanishes
for
odd
d.
Taking
the
mode
system
on
the
sphere
as
the
union
of
Neumann
and
Dirichlet
ones
on
the
hemisphere
is
a
basic
part
of
the
method
and
leads
to
a
heuristic
explanation
of
the
non--existence
of
`super--critical'
operators,
2k&gt;d
for
even
d.
Significant
use
is
made
of
the
Barnes
zeta
function.
The
results
are
given
in
terms
of
ratios
of
determinants
of
operators
on
a
(d+1)-dimensional
bulk
dual
sphere.
For
odd
dimensions,
the
log
determinant
is
written
in
terms
of
multiple
sine
functions
and
agreement
is
found
with
holographic
computations,
yielding
an
integral
over
a
Plancherel
measure.
The
N-D
determinant
ratio
is
also
found
explicitly
for
even
dimensions.
Ehrhart
polynomials
are
encountered.
