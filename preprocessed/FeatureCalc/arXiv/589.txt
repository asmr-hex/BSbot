Unitary
Truncations
and
Critical
Gravity:
a
Toy
Model
\\
We
investigate
a
higher-derivative
scalar
field
model
in
a
fixed
d+1
dimensional
AdS
background
as
a
toy
model
for
a
gravitational
dual
to
a
higher-rank
logarithmic
CFT.
The
holographic
two-point
correlation
functions
on
the
boundary
agree
with
higher-rank
LCFT
correlation
functions.
For
odd
rank,
the
theory
allows
for
a
truncation
to
a
nontrivial
subspace
with
non-negative
scalar
product.
We
discuss
possible
implications
for
higher-derivative
critical
gravity
theories.
