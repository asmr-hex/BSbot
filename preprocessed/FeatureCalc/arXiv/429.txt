Englert-type
solutions
of
d=11
supergravity
\\
A
family
of
geometries
on
S^7
arise
as
solutions
of
the
classical
equations
of
motion
in
11
dimensions.
In
addition
to
the
conventional
riemannian
geometry
and
the
two
exceptional
Cartan-Schouten
compact
flat
geometries
with
torsion,
one
can
also
obtain
non-flat
geometries
with
torsion.
This
torsion
is
given
locally
by
the
structure
constants
of
a
nonassociative
geodesic
loop
in
the
affinely
connected
space.
