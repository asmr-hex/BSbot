Comments
on
the
holographic
shear
viscosity
to
entropy
density
ratio
\\
We
revisit
the
membrane
paradigm
calculations
of
the
holographic
shear
viscosity
tensor
of
strongly
coupled
isotropic
plasmas
with
Einstein
gravity
dual
by
emphasizing
the
fact
which
was
overlooked
in
the
previous
literatures
that
the
shear
viscosity
is
a
fourth-rank
tensor.
Using
the
membrane
paradigm
we
show
that
depending
on
whether
the
holographic
shear
viscosity
tensor
to
entropy
density
ratio
is
\eta^j_i^j_i/s
or
\eta^{jiji}/s
or
\eta_{jiji}/s,
we
can
derive
three
distinct
formulae
for
the
holographic
shear
viscosity
tensor
to
entropy
density
ratios
given
explicitly
in
terms
of
the
background
metric
g_{ij}.
We
find
that
the
widely
studied
\eta^j_i^j_i/s
holographic
shear
viscosity
tensor
to
entropy
density
ratio
takes
the
universal
value
1/(4\pi)
for
isotropic
background
metric
g_{ij}
but
\eta^{jiji}/s
and
\eta_{jiji}/s
holographic
shear
viscosity
tensor
to
entropy
density
ratios
take
non-universal
values
which
depend
on
the
details
of
the
isotropic
background
metric
g_{ij}.
