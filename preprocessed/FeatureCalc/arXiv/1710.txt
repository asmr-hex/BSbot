M2-branes

Dimensional
Parents
via
Un-Higgsing
\\
N=2
quiver
Chern-Simons
theory
has
lately
attracted
attention
as
the
world
volume
theory
of
multiple
M2
branes
on
a
Calabi-Yau
4-fold.
We
study
the
connection
between
the
stringy
derivation
of
M2
brane
theories
and
the
forward
algorithm
which
gives
the
toric
Calabi-Yau
4-fold
as
the
moduli
space
of
the
quiver
theory.
Then
the
existence
of
the
3+1
dimensional
parent,
which
is
the
consistent
3+1
dimensional
superconformal
theory
with
the
same
quiver
diagram,
is
crucial
for
stringy
derivation
of
M2
brane
theories.
We
also
investigate
the
construction
of
M2
brane
theories
that
do
not
have
3+1
dimensional
parents.
The
un-Higgsing
procedure
plays
a
key
role
to
construct
these
M2
brane
theories.
We
find
some
N=2
quiver
Chern-Simons
theories
which
correspond
to
interesting
Calabi-Yau
singularities.
