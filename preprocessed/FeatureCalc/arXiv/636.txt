Four-Dimensional
SCFTs
from
M5-Branes
\\
We
engineer
a
large
new
set
of
four-dimensional
N=1
superconformal
field
theories
by
wrapping
M5-branes
on
complex
curves.
We
present
new
supersymmetric
AdS_5
M-theory
backgrounds
which
describe
these
fixed
points
at
large
N,
and
then
directly
construct
the
dual
four-dimensional
CFTs
for
a
certain
subset
of
these
solutions.
Additionally,
we
provide
a
direct
check
of
the
central
charges
of
these
theories
by
using
the
M5-brane
anomaly
polynomial.
This
is
a
companion
paper
which
elaborates
upon
results
reported
in
arXiv:1112:5487.
