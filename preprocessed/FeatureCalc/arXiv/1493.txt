Divergences
in
the
vacuum
energy
for
frequency-dependent
interactions
\\
We
propose
a
method
for
determining
ultra-violet
divergences
in
the
vacuum
energy
for
systems
whose
spectrum
of
perturbations
is
defined
through
a
non-linear
spectrum
problem,
i.e,
when
the
fluctuation
operator
itself
depends
on
the
frequency.
The
method
is
applied
to
the
plasma
shell
model,
which
describes
some
properties
of
the
interaction
of
electromagnetic
field
with
fullerens.
We
formulate
a
scalar
model,
which
simplifies
the
matrix
structure,
but
keeps
the
frequency
dependence
of
the
plasma
shell,
and
calculate
the
ultra-violet
divergences
in
the
case
when
the
plasma
sheet
is
slightly
curved.
The
divergent
terms
are
expressed
in
terms
of
surface
integrals
of
corresponding
invariants.
