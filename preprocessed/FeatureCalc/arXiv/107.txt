Phenomenological
studies
in
the
matrix
models
\\
Matrix
models
are
a
promising
candidate
for
a
nonperturbative
formulation
of
the
superstring
theory.
It
is
possible
to
study
how
the
standard
model
and
other
phenomenological
models
appear
from
the
matrix
model,
and
estimate
the
probability
distribution
of
their
appearance.
This
article
mainly
addresses
studies
in
toroidal
compactifications
with
magnetic
fluxes.
