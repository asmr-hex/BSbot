Holographic
dark
energy
with
non-minimal
coupling
\\
We
study
a
scalar
field
non-minimally
coupled
to
the
curvature,
in
the
framework
of
holographic
dark
energy.
We
obtain
a
relation
between
the
coupling
of
the
scalar
field
and
the
holographic
DE
parameters.
In
the
model
without
potential
we
found
the
EOS
parameter
in
different
regions
of
the
parameters,
giving
rise
to
accelerated
expansion.
For
some
restrictions
on
the
parameters,
the
model
presents
quintom
behavior.
