Timelike
U-dualities
in
Generalised
Geometry
\\
We
study
timelike
U-dualities
acting
in
three
and
four
directions
of
11-dimensional
supergravity,
which
form
the
groups
$SL(2)\times
SL(3)$
and
SL(5).
Using
generalised
geometry,
we
find
that
timelike
U-dualities,
despite
previous
conjectures,
do
not
change
the
signature
of
the
spacetime.
Furthermore,
we
prove
that
the
spacetime
signature
must
be
$(-,+,...,+)$
when
the
U-duality
modular
group
is
either
$\frac{SL(2)\times
SL(3)}{SO(1,1)\times
SO(2,1)}$
or
$\frac{SL(5)}{SO(3,2)}$.
We
find
that
for
some
dual
solutions
it
is
necessary
to
include
a
trivector
field
which
is
related
to
the
existence
of
non-geometric
fluxes
in
lower
dimensions.
In
the
second
part
of
the
paper,
we
explicitly
study
the
action
of
the
dualities
on
supergravity
solutions
corresponding
to
M2-branes.
For
a
finite
range
of
the
transformation,
the
action
of
$SL(2)\otimes
SL(3)$
on
the
worldvolume
of
uncharged
M2-branes
charges
them
while
it
changes
the
charge
of
extreme
M2-branes.
It
thus
acts
as
a
Harrison
transformation.
At
the
limits
of
the
range,
we
obtain
the
"subtracted
geometries"
which
correspond
to
an
infinite
Harrison
boost.
Outside
this
range
the
trivector
field
becomes
non-zero
and
we
obtain
a
dual
solution
that
cannot
be
uniquely
written
in
terms
of
a
metric,
3-form
and
trivector.
Instead
it
corresponds
to
a
family
of
solutions
linked
by
a
local
SO(1,1)
rotation.
The
SL(5)
duality
is
used
to
act
on
a
smeared
extreme
M2-brane
giving
a
brane-like
solution
carrying
momentum
in
the
transverse
direction
that
the
brane
was
delocalised
along.
