Notes
on
discrete
torsion
in
orientifolds
\\
In
this
short
note
we
discuss
discrete
torsion
in
orientifolds.
In
particular,
we
apply
the
physical
understanding
of
discrete
torsion
worked
out
several
years
ago,
as
group
actions
on
B
fields,
to
the
case
of
orientifolds,
and
recover
some
old
results
of
Braun
and
Stefanski
concerning
group
cohomology
and
twisted
equivariant
K
theory.
We
also
derive
new
results
including
phase
factors
for
nonorientable
worldsheets
and
analogues
for
C
fields.
