Five-loop
anomalous
dimension

critical

in

\\
We
compute
the
anomalous
dimension
of
a
length-five
operator
at
five-loop
order
in
the
SU(2)
sector
of
N=4
SYM
theory
in
the
planar
limit.
This
is
critical
wrapping
order
at
five
loops.
The
result
is
obtained
perturbatively
by
means
of
N=1
superspace
techniques.
Our
result
from
perturbation
theory
confirms
explicitly
the
formula
conjectured
in
