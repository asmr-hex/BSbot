Constructive
Renormalization
of
2-dimensional
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
Model
\\
In
this
talk
we
briefly
report
the
recent
work
on
the
construction
of
the
2-dimensional
Grosse-Wulkenhaar
model
with
the
method
of
loop
vertex
expansion.
We
treat
renormalization
with
this
new
tool,
adapt
Nelson's
argument
and
prove
Borel
summability
of
the
perturbation
series.
This
is
the
first
non-commutative
quantum
field
theory
model
to
be
built
in
a
non-perturbative
sense.
