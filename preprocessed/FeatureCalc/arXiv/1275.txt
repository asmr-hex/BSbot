Modifying
the
Sum
Over
Topological
Sectors
and
Constraints
on
Supergravity
\\
The
standard
lore
about
the
sum
over
topological
sectors
in
quantum
field
theory
is
that
locality
and
cluster
decomposition
uniquely
determine
the
sum
over
such
sectors,
thus
leading
to
the
usual
theta-vacua.
We
show
that
without
changing
the
local
degrees
of
freedom,
a
theory
can
be
modified
such
that
the
sum
over
instantons
should
be
restricted;
e.g.
one
should
include
only
instanton
numbers
which
are
divisible
by
some
integer
p.
This
conclusion
about
the
configuration
space
of
quantum
field
theory
allows
us
to
carefully
reconsider
the
quantization
of
parameters
in
supergravity.
In
particular,
we
show
that
FI-terms
and
nontrivial
Kahler
forms
are
quantized.
This
analysis
also
leads
to
a
new
derivation
of
recent
results
about
linearized
supergravity.
