Chameleonic
dilaton,
nonequivalent
frames,
and
the
cosmological
constant
problem
in
quantum
string
theory
\\
The
chameleonic
behaviour
of
the
String
theory
dilaton
is
suggested.
Some
of
the
possible
consequences
of
the
chameleonic
string
dilaton
are
analyzed
in
detail.
In
particular,
(1)
we
suggest
a
new
stringy
solution
to
the
cosmological
constant
problem
and
(2)
we
point
out
the
non-equivalence
of
different
conformal
frames
at
the
quantum
level.
In
order
to
obtain
these
results,
we
start
taking
into
account
the
(strong
coupling)
string
loop
expansion
in
the
string
frame
(S-frame),
therefore
the
so-called
form
factors
are
present
in
the
effective
action.
The
correct
Dark
Energy
scale
is
recovered
in
the
Einstein
frame
(E-frame)
without
unnatural
fine-tunings
and
this
result
is
robust
against
all
quantum
corrections,
granted
that
we
assume
a
proper
structure
of
the
S-frame
form
factors
in
the
strong
coupling
regime.
At
this
stage,
the
possibility
still
exists
that
a
certain
amount
of
fine-tuning
may
be
required
to
satisfy
some
phenomenological
constraints.
Moreover
in
the
E-frame,
in
our
proposal,
all
the
interactions
are
switched
off
on
cosmological
length
scales
(i.e.
the
theory
is
IR-free),
while
higher
derivative
gravitational
terms
might
be
present
locally
(on
short
distances)
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
these
facts
clash
with
phenomenology.
A
detailed
phenomenological
analysis
is
definitely
necessary
to
clarify
these
points.
