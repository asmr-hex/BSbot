Matter:
Adjoint
Transitions
\\
A
large
class
of
duality
cascades
based
on
quivers
arising
from
non-isolated
singularities
enjoy
adjoint
transitions
-
a
phenomenon
which
occurs
when
the
gauge
coupling
of
a
node
possessing
adjoint
matter
is
driven
to
strong
coupling
in
a
manner
resulting
in
a
reduction
of
rank
in
the
non-Abelian
part
of
the
gauge
group
and
a
subsequent
flow
to
weaker
coupling.
We
describe
adjoint
transitions
in
a
simple
family
of
cascades
based
on
a
Z2-orbifold
of
the
conifold
using
field
theory.
We
show
that
they
are
dual
to
Higgsing
and
produce
varying
numbers
of
U(1)
factors,
moduli,
and
monopoles
in
a
manner
which
we
calculate.
This
realizes
a
large
family
of
cascades
which
proceed
through
Seiberg
duality
and
Higgsing.
We
briefly
describe
the
supergravity
limit
of
our
analysis,
as
well
as
a
prescription
for
treating
more
general
theories.
A
special
role
is
played
by
N=2
SQCD.
Our
results
suggest
that
additional
light
fields
are
typically
generated
when
UV
completing
certain
constructions
of
spontaneous
supersymmetry
breaking
into
cascades,
potentially
leading
to
instabilities.
