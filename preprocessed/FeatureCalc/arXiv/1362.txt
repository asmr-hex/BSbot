Fragile
Black
Holes
\\
The
AdS/CFT
correspondence
may
give
a
new
way
of
understanding
field
theories
in
extreme
conditions,
as
in
the
quark-gluon
plasma
phase
of
quark
matter.
The
correspondence
normally
involves
asymptotically
AdS
black
holes
with
dual
field
theories
which
are
defined
on
locally
flat
boundary
spacetimes;
the
implicit
assumption
is
that
the
distortions
of
spacetime
which
occur
under
extreme
conditions
do
not
affect
the
field
theory
in
any
unexpected
way.
However,
AdS
black
holes
are
[to
varying
degrees]
"fragile",
in
the
sense
that
they
become
unstable
to
stringy
effects
when
their
event
horizons
are
sufficiently
distorted.
This
implies
that
field
theories
on
curved
backgrounds
may
likewise
be
unstable
in
a
suitable
sense.
We
investigate
this
phenomenon,
focussing
on
the
"fragility"
of
AdS
black
holes
with
flat
event
horizons.
We
find
that,
when
they
are
distorted,
these
black
holes
are
always
unstable
in
string
theory.
This
may
have
consequences
for
the
detailed
structure
of
the
quark
matter
phase
diagram
at
extreme
values
of
the
spacetime
curvature.
