Slowly
Rotating
Black
Holes
in
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell
Theory
\\
In
this
paper,
we
construct
a
class
of
(n+1)-dimensional
$(n\geq4)$
slowly
rotating
black
hole
solutions
in
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell
theory
with
a
quadratic
potential.
These
solutions
can
represent
black
holes
with
inner
and
outer
event
horizons,
an
extreme
black
hole
and
a
naked
singularity
and
they
are
neither
asymptotically
flat
nor
(anti)-de
Sitter.
We
compute
the
Euclidean
action
and
use
it
to
obtain
the
conserved
and
thermodynamics
quantities
such
as
entropy,
which
does
not
obey
the
area
law.
We
also
compute
the
angular
momentum
and
the
gyromagnetic
ratio
for
these
type
of
black
holes
where
the
gyromagnetic
ratio
is
modified
in
Brans-Dicke
theory
compared
to
the
Einstein
theory.
