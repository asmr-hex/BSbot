We
analytically
compute
correlation
and
response
functions
of
scalar
operators
for
the
systems
with
Galilean
and
corresponding
aging
symmetries
for
general
spatial
dimensions
$d$
and
dynamical
exponent
$z$,
along
with
their
logarithmic
and
logarithmic
squared
extensions,
using
the
gauge/gravity
duality.
These
non-conformal
extensions
of
the
aging
geometry
are
marked
by
two
dimensionful
parameters,
eigenvalue
$\mathcal
M$
of
an
internal
coordinate
and
aging
parameter
$\alpha$.
