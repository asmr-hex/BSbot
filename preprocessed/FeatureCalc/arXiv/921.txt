Open
topological
strings
and
integrable
hierarchies:
Remodeling
the
A-model
\\
We
set
up,
purely
in
A-model
terms,
a
novel
formalism
for
the
global
solution
of
the
open
and
closed
topological
A-model
on
toric
Calabi-Yau
threefolds.
The
starting
point
is
to
build
on
recent
progress
in
the
mathematical
theory
of
open
Gromov-Witten
invariants
of
orbifolds;
we
interpret
the
localization
formulae
as
relating
D-brane
amplitudes
to
closed
string
amplitudes
perturbed
with
twisted
masses
through
an
analogue
of
the
"loop
insertion
operator"
of
matrix
models.
We
first
generalize
this
form
of
open/closed
string
duality
to
general
toric
backgrounds
in
all
chambers
of
the
stringy
Kaehler
moduli
space;
secondly,
we
display
a
neat
connection
of
the
(gauged)
closed
string
side
to
tau
functions
of
1+1
Hamiltonian
integrable
hierarchies,
and
exploit
it
to
provide
an
effective
computation
of
open
string
amplitudes.
In
doing
so,
we
also
provide
a
systematic
treatment
of
the
change
of
flat
open
moduli
induced
by
a
phase
transition
in
the
closed
moduli
space.
We
test
our
proposal
in
detail
by
providing
an
extensive
number
of
checks.
We
also
use
our
formalism
to
give
a
localization-based
derivation
of
the
Hori-Vafa
spectral
curves
as
coming
from
a
resummation
of
A-model
disc
instantons.
