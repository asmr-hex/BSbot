Photon
and
photino
as
Nambu-Goldstone
zero
modes
in
an
emergent

QED
\\
We
argue
that
supersymmetry
with
its
well
known
advantages,
such
as
naturalness,
grand
unification
and
dark
matter
candidate
seems
to
possess
one
more
attractive
feature:
it
may
trigger,
through
its
own
spontaneous
violation
in
the
visible
sector,
a
dynamical
generation
of
gauge
fields
as
massless
Nambu-Goldstone
modes
during
which
physical
Lorentz
invariance
itself
is
ultimately
preserved.
We
consider
the
supersymmetric
QED
model
extended
by
an
arbitrary
polynomial
potential
of
massive
vector
superfield
that
breaks
gauge
invariance
in
the
SUSY
invariant
phase.
However,
the
requirement
of
vacuum
stability
in
such
class
of
models
makes
both
supersymmetry
and
Lorentz
invariance
to
become
spontaneously
broken.
As
a
consequence,
massless
photino
and
photon
appear
as
the
corresponding
Nambu-Goldstone
zero
modes
in
an
emergent
SUSY
QED,
and
also
a
special
gauge
invariance
is
simultaneously
generated.
Due
to
this
invariance
all
observable
relativistically
noninvariant
effects
appear
to
be
completely
cancelled
out
among
themselves
and
physical
Lorentz
invariance
is
recovered.
Nevertheless,
such
theories
may
have
an
inevitable
observational
evidence
in
terms
of
the
goldstino-photino
like
state
presented
in
the
low-energy
particle
spectrum.
Its
study
is
of
a
special
interest
for
this
class
of
SUSY
models
that,
apart
from
some
indication
of
an
emergence
nature
of
QED
and
the
Standard
Model,
may
appreciably
extend
the
scope
of
SUSY
breaking
physics
being
actively
studied
in
recent
years.
