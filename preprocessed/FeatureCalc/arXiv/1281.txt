An
Efficient
Method
for
the
Solution

\\
Efficient
computation
methods
are
devised
for
the
perturbative
solution
of
Schwinger--Dyson
equations
for
propagators.
We
show
how
a
simple
computation
allows
to
obtain
the
dominant
contribution
in
the
sum
of
many
parts
of
previous
computations.
This
allows
for
an
easy
study
of
the
asymptotic
behavior
of
the
perturbative
series.
In
the
cases
of
the
four-dimensional
supersymmetric
Wess--Zumino
model
and
the
$\phi_6^3$
complex
scalar
field,
the
singularities
of
the
Borel
transform
for
both
positive
and
negative
values
of
the
parameter
are
obtained
and
compared.
