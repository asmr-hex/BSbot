\\
We
consider
the
space
of
boundary
conditions
of
Virasoro
minimal
models
formed
from
the
composition
of
a
collection
of
flows
generated
by
\phi_{1,3}.
These
have
recently
been
shown
to
fall
naturally
into
a
sequence,
each
term
having
a
coordinate
on
it
in
terms
of
a
boundary
parameter,
but
no
global
parameter
has
been
proposed.
Here
we
investigate
the
idea
that
the
overlaps
of
particular
bulk
states
with
the
boundary
states
give
natural
coordinates
on
the
moduli
space
of
boundary
conditions.
We
find
formulae
for
these
overlaps
using
the
known
thermodynamic
Bethe
Ansatz
descriptions
of
the
ground
and
first
excited
state
on
the
cylinder
and
show
that
they
give
a
global
coordinate
on
the
space
of
boundary
conditions,
showing
it
is
smooth
and
compact
as
expected.
