We
exactly
evaluate
the
partition
function
(index)
of
N=4
supersymmetric
quiver
quantum
mechanics
in
the
Higgs
phase
by
using
the
localization
techniques.
We
show
that
the
path
integral
is
localized
at
the
fixed
points,
which
are
obtained
by
solving
the
BRST
equations,
and
D-term
and
F-term
conditions.
We
turn
on
background
gauge
fields
of
R-symmetries
for
the
chiral
multiplets
corresponding
to
the
arrows
between
quiver
nodes,
but
the
partition
function
does
not
depend
on
these
R-charges.
We
give
explicit
examples
of
the
quiver
theory
including
a
non-coprime
dimension
vector.
The
partition
functions
completely
agree
with
the
mathematical
formulas
of
the
Poincare
polynomials
and
the
wall
crossing
for
the
quiver
moduli
spaces
.
We
also
discuss
exact
computation
of
the
expectation
values
of
supersymmetric
(Q-closed)
Wilson
loops
in
the
quiver
theory.
