Reformulation
of
Yang-Mills
Theories
with
Space-time
Tensor
Fields
\\
We
provide
the
reformulation
of
Yang-Mills
theories
in
terms
of
gauge
invariant
metric-like
variables
in
three
and
four
dimensions.
The
reformulations
are
used
to
analyze
the
dimension
two
gluon
condensate
and
give
gauge
invariant
descriptions
of
gluon
polarization.
In
three
dimensions,
we
obtain
a
non-zero
dimension
two
gluon
condensate,
whose
value
is
similar
to
the
square
of
photon
mass
in
the
Schwinger
model.
In
four
dimensions,
we
obtain
a
Lagrangian
with
the
dual
property,
which
shares
the
similar
but
different
property
with
the
dual
superconductor
scenario.
