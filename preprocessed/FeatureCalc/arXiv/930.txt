On
factorizations
in
perturbative
quantum
gravity
\\
Some
features
of
Einstein
gravity
are
most
easily
understood
from
string
theory
but
are
not
manifest
at
the
level
of
the
usual
Lagrangian
formulation.
One
example
is
the
factorization
of
gravity
amplitudes
into
gauge
theory
amplitudes.
Based
on
the
recently
constructed
`double
field
theory'
and
a
geometrical
frame-like
formalism
developed
by
Siegel,
we
provide
a
framework
of
perturbative
Einstein
gravity
coupled
to
a
2-form
and
a
dilaton
in
which,
as
a
consequence
of
T-duality,
the
Feynman
rules
factorize
to
all
orders
in
perturbation
theory.
We
thereby
establish
the
precise
relation
between
the
field
variables
in
different
formulations
and
discuss
the
Lagrangian
that,
when
written
in
terms
of
these
variables,
makes
a
left-right
factorization
manifest.
