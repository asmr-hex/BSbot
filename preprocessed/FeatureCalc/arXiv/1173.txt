Divergences
in
Scalar
Quantum
Field
Theory:
The
Cause
and
the
Cure
\\
Covariant
scalar
fields
exhibit
divergences
when
quantized
in
two
or
more
spacetime
dimensions:
n
\geg
2.
Does
perturbation
theory,
effective
theories,
the
renormalization
group,
etc.,
tell
us
all
there
is
to
know
about
these
problems?
An
alternative
approach
identifies
the
cause
of
divergences
as
due
to
the
effort
to
multiplicatively
relate
two
measures
that
are
mutually
singular,
while
the
cure
for
those
divergences
is
to
introduce
an
O(\hbar)
counterterm
that
converts
mutually
singular
measures
into
equivalent
measures.
This
procedure
leads
to
a
nontrivial,
divergence-free
formulation
for
all
n
\geq
2.
Finally,
a
critical
comparison
of
the
new
methods
with
traditional
procedures
is
given.
