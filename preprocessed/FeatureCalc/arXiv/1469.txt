Thermodynamics
of
apparent
horizon
and
modified
Friedman
equations
\\
Starting
from
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
$dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$,
at
apparent
horizon
of
a
FRW
universe,
and
assuming
that
the
associated
entropy
with
apparent
horizon
has
a
quantum
corrected
relation,
$S=\frac{A}{4G}-\alpha
\ln
\frac{A}{4G}+\beta
\frac{4G}{A}$,
we
derive
modified
Friedmann
equations
describing
the
dynamics
of
the
universe
with
any
spatial
curvature.
We
also
examine
the
time
evolution
of
the
total
entropy
including
the
quantum
corrected
entropy
associated
with
the
apparent
horizon
together
with
the
matter
field
entropy
inside
the
apparent
horizon.
Our
study
shows
that,
with
the
local
equilibrium
assumption,
the
generalized
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
fulfilled
in
a
region
enclosed
by
the
apparent
horizon.
