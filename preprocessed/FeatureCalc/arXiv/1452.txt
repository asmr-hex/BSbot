Continuum
Limit
of
gl(M/N)
Spin
Chains
\\
We
study
the
spectrum
of
an
integrable
antiferromagnetic
Hamiltonian
of
the
gl(M|N)
spin
chain
of
alternating
fundamental
and
dual
representations.
After
extensive
numerical
analysis,
we
identify
the
vacuum
and
low
lying
excitations
and
with
this
knowledge
perform
the
continuum
limit,
while
keeping
a
finite
gap.
All
gl(n+N|N)
spin
chains
with
n,N&gt;0
are
shown
to
possess
in
the
continuum
limit
2n-2
multiplets
of
massive
particles
which
scatter
with
gl(n)
Gross-Neveu
like
S-matrices,
namely
their
eigenvalues
do
not
depend
on
N.
We
argue
that
the
continuum
theory
is
the
gl(M|N)
Gross-Neveu
model.
We
then
look
for
remaining
particles
in
the
gl(2m|1)
chains.
The
results
suggest
there
is
a
continuum
of
such
particles,
which
in
order
to
be
fully
understood
require
finite
volume
calculations.
