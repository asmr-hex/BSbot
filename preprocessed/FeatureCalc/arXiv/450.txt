The
abelian
confinement
mechanism
revisited:
new
aspects
of
the
Georgi-Glashow
model
\\
The
confinement
problem
remains
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
in
theoretical
physics.
An
important
step
toward
the
solution
of
this
problem
is
the
Polyakov's
work
on
abelian
confinement.
The
Georgi-Glashow
model
is
a
natural
testing
ground
for
this
mechanism
which
has
been
surprising
us
by
its
richness
and
wide
applicability.
In
this
work,
we
shed
light
on
two
new
aspects
of
this
model
in
2+1
D.
First,
we
develop
a
many-body
description
of
the
effective
degrees
of
freedom.
Namely,
we
consider
a
non-relativistic
gas
of
W-bosons
in
the
background
of
monopole-instanton
plasma.
Many-body
treatment
is
a
standard
toolkit
in
condensed
matter
physics.
However,
we
add
a
new
twist
by
supplying
the
monopole-instantons
as
external
background
field.
Using
this
construction,
we
calculate
the
exact
form
of
the
potential
between
two
electric
probes
as
a
function
of
their
separation.
This
potential
is
expressed
in
terms
of
the
Meijer-G
function
which
interpolates
between
logarithmic
and
linear
behavior
at
small
and
large
distances,
respectively.
Second,
we
develop
a
systematic
approach
to
integrate
out
the
effect
of
the
W-bosons
at
finite
temperature
in
the
range
0&lt;T&lt;M_W,
where
M_W
is
the
W-boson
mass,
starting
from
the
full
relativistic
partition
function
of
the
Georgi-Glashow
model.
Using
a
heat
kernel
expansion
that
takes
into
account
the
non-trivial
thermal
holonomy,
we
show
that
the
partition
function
describes
a
three-dimensional
two-component
Coulomb
gas.
We
repeat
our
analysis
using
the
many-body
description
which
yields
the
same
result
and
provides
a
check
on
our
formalism.
At
temperatures
close
to
the
deconfinement
temperature,
the
gas
becomes
essentially
two-dimensional
recovering
the
partition
function
of
the
dual
sine-Gordon
model
that
was
considered
in
a
previous
work.
