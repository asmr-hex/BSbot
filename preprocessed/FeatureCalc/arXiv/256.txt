Gauge
Transformation
of
Double
Field
Theory
for
Open
String
\\
I
combine
the
symmetry
structure
of
both
the
normal
and
transverse
coordinates
to
construct
the
Dirac-Born-Infeld
(DBI)
theory.
Normal
coordinates
are
dual
to
Neumann
boundary
conditions
and
transverse
coordinates
dual
to
Dirichlet
boundary
conditions.
The
gauge
transformation
of
the
generalized
metric
is
also
governed
by
the
generalized
Lie
derivative
as
the
massless
closed
string
field
theory.
The
massless
closed
string
field
theory
gives
$C$-bracket,
but
the
DBI
theory
gives
the
$F$-bracket
from
the
closed
algebra.
The
$F$-bracket
can
be
a
$\alpha^{\prime}$
deformation
of
the
$C$-bracket.
From
the
symmetry,
we
can
deduce
the
suitable
action
with
non-zero
flux
in
open
string.
From
the
equations
of
motion
of
the
scalar
dilaton,
it
offers
the
generalized
scalar
curvature.
Finally,
I
show
the
classical
equivalence
between
the
double
sigma
model
and
normal
sigma
model
for
open
string.
