Gribov
horizon
and
BRST
symmetry:
a
pathway
to
confinement
\\
We
summarize
the
construction
of
the
Gribov-Zwanziger
action
and
how
it
leads
to
a
scenario
which
explains
the
confinement
of
gluons,
in
the
sense
that
the
elementary
gluon
excitations
violate
positivity.
Then
we
address
the
question
of
how
one
can
construct
operators
within
this
picture
whose
one-loop
correlation
functions
have
the
correct
analytic
properties
in
order
to
correspond
to
physical
excitations.
For
this
we
introduce
the
concept
of
i-particles.
