Permutation
orientifolds
and
enhanced
singularities
\\
In
this
paper,
a
procedure
is
developed
to
construct
compact
F-theory
fourfolds
corresponding
to
perturbative
IIB
O7/O3
models
on
CICY
threefolds
with
permutation
involutions.
The
method
is
explained
in
generality,
and
then
applied
to
specific
examples
where
the
involution
permutes
two
Del
Pezzo
surfaces.
The
fourfold
construction
is
successfully
tested
by
comparing
the
D3
charges
predicted
by
F-theory
and
IIB
string
theory.
The
constructed
smooth
fourfolds
are
then
taken
to
the
locus
in
moduli
space
where
they
have
enhanced
SU(5)
singularities.
A
general,
intuitive
method
is
developed
for
engineering
the
desired
singularities
in
Weierstrass
models
for
complicated
D7-brane
setups.
