M5-brane
Defect

QHE
in

x
N(1,1)/N=3
SCFT
\\
We
study
the
$d=11$
gravity
dual
$AdS_4\times
N(1,1)$
of
the
$d=3$
$\mathcal{N}=3$
flavored
Chern-Simons-matter
(CSM)
theory.
In
the
dual
gravity
side,
we
analyze
the
M5-brane
making
the
edge
on
the
boundary
of
$AdS_4$
and
derive
the
quantized
Hall
conductivity
of
the
dual
gauge
theory.
In
the
gauge
theory
side,
this
M5-brane
intersects
the
gauge
theory
at
the
codimension-one
defect.
