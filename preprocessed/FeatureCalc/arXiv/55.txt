The
Scalar
Field
Effective
Action
for
The
Spontaneous
Symmetry
Breaking
in
Gravity
\\
We
calculate
the
quantum
effective
action
for
a
scalar
field
which
has
been
recently
used
for
a
specific
kind
of
symmetry
breaking
in
gravity.
Our
study
consists
of
calculating
the
1-loop
path
integral
of
canonical
momentum
and
determining
the
renormalization
conditions.
We
will
also
discuss
on
the
new
renormalization
conditions
to
redefine
the
new
degrees
of
freedom
corresponding
to
a
massive
vector
field.
