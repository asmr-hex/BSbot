Higher
Gauge
Theory
and
M-Theory
\\
In
this
thesis,
the
emerging
field
of
higher
gauge
theory
will
be
discussed,
particularly
in
relation
to
problems
arising
in
M-theory,
such
as
selfdual
strings
and
the
so-called
(2,0)
theory.
This
thesis
will
begin
with
a
Nahm-like
construction
for
selfdual
strings
using
loop
space,
the
space
of
loops
on
spacetime.
This
construction
maps
solutions
of
the
Basu-Harvey
equation,
the
BPS
equation
arising
in
the
description
of
multiple
M2-branes,
to
solutions
of
a
selfdual
string
equation
on
loop
space.
Furthermore,
all
ingredients
of
the
construction
reduce
to
those
of
the
ordinary
Nahm
construction
when
compactified
on
a
circle
with
all
loops
restricted
to
those
wrapping
the
circle.
The
rest
of
this
thesis,
however,
will
not
involve
loop
space.
We
will
see
a
Nahm-like
construction
for
the
case
of
infinitely
many
selfdual
strings,
suspended
between
two
M5-branes.
This
is
possible
since
the
limit
taken
renders
the
fields
describing
the
M5-branes
abelian.
This
avoids
the
problem
which
the
rest
of
this
thesis
focuses
on:
What
fields
describe
multiple
M5-branes?
The
answer
is
likely
to
involve
higher
gauge
theory,
a
categorification
of
gauge
theory
which
describes
the
parallel
transport
of
extended
objects.
Any
theories
which
involves
3-algebras,
including
current
M2-brane
models
and
the
Lambert-Papageorgakis
M5-brane
model,
are
examples
of
higher
gauge
theories.
Recently,
a
class
of
models
with
N=(1,0)
supersymmetry
have
been
found,
with
significant
overlap
with
algebraic
structures
in
higher
gauge
theory.
This
overlap
suggests
that
the
full
N=(2,0)
theory
could
involve
semistrict
$L_\infty$-algebras.
Finally,
we
will
see
some
explicit
selfdual
string
solutions,
which
may
fit
into
these
frameworks.
