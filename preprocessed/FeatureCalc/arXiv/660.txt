Mutation
Symmetries
in
BPS
Quiver
Theories:
Building
the
BPS
Spectra
\\
We
study
the
basic
features
of
BPS
quiver
mutations
in
4D
$\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetric
quantum
field
theory
with
$G=ADE$
gauge
symmetries.\
We
show,
for
these
gauge
symmetries,
that
there
is
an
isotropy
group
$\mathcal{G}_{Mut}^{G}$
associated
to
a
set
of
quiver
mutations
capturing
information
about
the
BPS
spectra.
In
the
strong
coupling
limit,
it
is
shown
that
BPS
chambers
correspond
to
finite
and
closed
groupoid
orbits
with
an
isotropy
symmetry
group
$\mathcal{G}_{strong}^{G}$
isomorphic
to
the
discrete
dihedral
groups
$Dih_{2h_{G}}$
contained
in
Coxeter$(G)
$
with
$%
h_{G}$
the
Coxeter
number
of
G.
These
isotropy
symmetries
allow
to
determine
the
BPS
spectrum
of
the
strong
coupling
chamber;
and
give
another
way
to
count
the
total
number
of
BPS
and
anti-BPS
states
of
$\mathcal{N}=2$
gauge
theories.
We
also
build
the
matrix
realization
of
these
mutation
groups
$%
\mathcal{G}_{strong}^{G}$
from
which
we
read
directly
the
electric-magnetic
charges
of
the
BPS
and
anti-BPS
states
of
$\mathcal{N}=2$
QFT$_{4}$
as
well
as
their
matrix
intersections.
We
study
as
well
the
quiver
mutation
symmetries
in
the
weak
coupling
limit
and
give
their
links
with
infinite
Coxeter
groups.
We
show
amongst
others
that
$\mathcal{G}_{weak}^{su_{2}}$
is
contained
in
${GL}({2,}\mathbb{Z})
$;
and
isomorphic
to
the
infinite
Coxeter
${I_{2}^{\infty}}$.
Other
issues
such
as
building
$\mathcal{G}%_{weak}^{so_{4}}$
and
$\mathcal{G}_{weak}^{su_{3}}$
are
also
studied.
