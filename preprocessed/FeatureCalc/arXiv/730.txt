A
Vacuum
Solution
with
Torsion
in
Higher-Derivative
Gravity
\\
In
this
paper,
we
provide
a
vacuum
solution
with
torsion
in
quadratic
Riemann-curvature
gravity.
Physically,
the
solution
means
that
vacuum
can
have
a
nonzero
vacuum
field
with
large
torsion.
We
show
that
the
Einstein-Hilbert
action
can
be
derived
if
we
expand
the
quadratic
curvature
of
the
Lagrangian
in
a
torsion-free
Riemannian
space-time
around
a
nonzero
vacuum
field.
We
also
show
that
the
cosmological
constant
caused
by
a
nonzero
vacuum
field
is
equal
to
zero.
