Planck

and
Superconformal
Symmetry
\\
We
explain
why
the
concept
of
a
spontaneously
broken
superconformal
symmetry
is
useful
to
describe
inflationary
models
favored
by
the
Planck.
Non-minimal
coupling
of
complex
scalars
to
curvature,
N(X,
X*)
R,
is
compulsory
for
superconformal
symmetry.
Here
N
is
the
Kahler
potential
of
the
embedding
moduli
space,
including
the
inflaton
and
the
conformon.
It
appears
that
such
a
non-minimal
coupling
allows
generic
chaotic
models
of
inflation
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
observable
(n_{s},r)
values.
We
describe
here
the
superconformal
versions
of
the
cosmological
attractors
whose
bosonic
part
was
presented
in
lectures
of
A.
Linde
in
this
volume.
A
distinguishing
feature
of
this
class
of
models
is
that
they
tend
to
lead
to
very
similar
predictions
which
are
not
very
sensitive
with
respect
to
strong
modifications
of
the
theory.
The
(super)conformal
symmetry
underlying
(super)gravity
allows
a
universal
description
of
a
large
class
of
models
which
agree
with
observations
and
predict
the
tensor
to
scalar
ratio
10^{-3}
&lt;
r
&lt;
10^{-1}.
