Killing-Yano
tensors
and
some
applications
\\
The
role
of
Killing
and
Killing-Yano
tensors
for
studying
the
geodesic
motion
of
the
particle
and
the
superparticle
in
a
curved
background
is
reviewed.
Additionally
the
Papadopoulos
list
[74]
for
Killing-Yano
tensors
in
G
structures
is
reproduced
by
studying
the
torsion
types
these
structures
admit.
The
Papadopoulos
list
deals
with
groups
G
appearing
in
the
Berger
classification,
and
we
enlarge
the
list
by
considering
additional
G
structures
which
are
not
of
the
Berger
type.
Possible
applications
of
these
results
in
the
study
of
supersymmetric
particle
actions
and
in
the
AdS/CFT
correspondence
are
outlined.
