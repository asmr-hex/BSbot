Holographic
Entanglement
Entropy
and
Confinement
\\
We
study
the
phase
transition
in
the
holographic
entanglement
entropy
for
various
confining
models.
This
transition
occurs
for
the
entanglement
entropy
of
a
strip
at
a
critical
value
of
the
strip
width.
Our
main
interest
is
to
examine
the
critical
width
for
models
with
several
parameters.
For
these
models,
the
critical
width,
the
glueball
mass
and
the
string
tension
all
become
functions
of
these
two
parameters.
Comparing
the
behavior
of
the
critical
width
in
the
entanglement
entropy
and
these
other
scales,
we
find
that
$l_c$
seems
to
follow
closely
the
deconfinement
temperature
and
the
glueball
mass.
The
behavior
of
the
string
tension
is
similar
to
$l_c$,
despite
of
being
parametrically
smaller
than
the
other
quantities.
