Weighted
Laplacians,

\\
Hodge's
formula
represents
the
gravitational
MHV
amplitude
as
the
determinant
of
a
minor
of
a
certain
matrix.
When
expanded,
this
determinant
becomes
a
sum
over
weighted
trees,
which
is
the
form
of
the
MHV
formula
first
obtained
by
Bern,
Dixon,
Perelstein,
Rozowsky
and
rediscovered
by
Nguyen,
Spradlin,
Volovich
and
Wen.
The
gravity
MHV
amplitude
satisfies
the
Britto,
Cachazo,
Feng
and
Witten
recursion
relation.
The
main
building
block
of
the
MHV
amplitude,
the
so-called
half-soft
function,
satisfies
a
different,
Berends-Giele-type
recursion
relation.
We
show
that
all
these
facts
are
illustrations
to
a
more
general
story.
