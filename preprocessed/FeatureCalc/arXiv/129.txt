Topological
Dirac
variables
in
Abelian
$U(1)$
theory
\\
In
this
study
we,
remembering
the
experience
with
topological
Dirac
variables
in
the
non-Abelian
Yang-Mills-Higgs
(YMH)
model
with
vacuuum
BPS
monopole
solutions,
attempt
to
construct
similar
for
the
Abelian
$U(1)$
model.
We
show
that
QED,
as
one
understands
it
commonly,
is
only
the
topologically
trivial
sector
($n=0$)
of
this
Abelian
$U(1)$
model.
For
$n\neq
0$
one
gets
Dirac
monopole
modes.
In
both
the
cases,
$n=0$
and
$n\neq
0$,
the
theory
can
be
quantized
via
the
Hamiltonian
reduction
in
terms
of
Dirac
variables.
