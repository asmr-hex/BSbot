Perturbations
of
moving
membranes
in
AdS_7
\\
We
study
the
stability
of
uniformly
moving
membrane-like
objects
in
seven
dimensional
Anti-de
Sitter
space.
This
is
approached
by
a
linear
perturbation
analysis
and
a
search
for
growing
modes.
We
examine
both
analytic
and
numerical
configurations
previously
found
in
[1].
