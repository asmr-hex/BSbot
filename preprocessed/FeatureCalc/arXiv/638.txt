Supersymmetric
Gauge
Theories
on
the
Five-Sphere
\\
We
construct
Euclidean
5d
supersymmetric
gauge
theories
on
the
five-sphere
with
vector
and
hypermultiplets.
The
SUSY
transformation
and
the
action
are
explicitly
determined
from
the
standard
Noether
procedure
as
well
as
from
off-shell
supergravity.
Using
localization
techniques,
the
path-integral
is
shown
to
be
restricted
to
the
integration
over
a
generalization
of
instantons
on
CP^2
and
the
Coulomb
moduli.
