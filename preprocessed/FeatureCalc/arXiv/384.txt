2d
Index
and
Surface
operators
\\
In
this
paper
we
compute
the
superconformal
index
of
2d
(2,2)
supersymmetric
gauge
theories.
The
2d
superconformal
index,
a.k.a.
flavored
elliptic
genus,
is
computed
by
a
unitary
matrix
integral
much
like
the
matrix
integral
that
computes
4d
superconformal
index.
We
compute
the
2d
index
explicitly
for
a
number
of
examples.
In
the
case
of
abelian
gauge
theories
we
see
that
the
index
is
invariant
under
flop
transition
and
CY-LG
correspondence.
The
index
also
provides
a
powerful
check
of
the
Seiberg-type
duality
for
non-abelian
gauge
theories
discovered
by
Hori
and
Tong.
