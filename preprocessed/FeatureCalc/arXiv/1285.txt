Toward
a
first-principle
derivation
of
confinement
and
chiral-symmetry-breaking
crossover
transitions
in
QCD
\\
We
give
a
theoretical
framework
to
obtain
a
low-energy
effective
theory
of
quantum
chromodynamics
(QCD)
towards
a
first-principle
derivation
of
confinement/deconfinement
and
chiral-symmetry
breaking/restoration
crossover
transitions.
In
fact,
we
demonstrate
that
an
effective
theory
obtained
using
simple
but
non-trivial
approximations
within
this
framework
enables
us
to
treat
both
transitions
simultaneously
on
equal
footing.
A
resulting
effective
theory
is
regarded
as
a
modified
and
improved
version
of
nonlocal
Polyakov-loop
extended
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(nonlocal
PNJL)
models
proposed
recently
by
Hell,
R\"ossner,
Cristoforetti
and
Weise,
and
Sasaki,
Friman
and
Redlich,
extending
the
original
(local)
PNJL
model
by
Fukushima
and
others.
A
novel
feature
is
that
the
nonlocal
NJL
coupling
depends
explicitly
on
the
temperature
and
Polyakov
loop,
which
affects
the
entanglement
between
confinement
and
chiral
symmetry
breaking,
together
with
the
cross
term
introduced
through
the
covariant
derivative
in
the
quark
sector
considered
in
the
conventional
PNJL
model.
The
chiral
symmetry
breaking/restoration
transition
is
controlled
by
the
nonlocal
NJL
interaction,
while
the
confinement/deconfinement
transition
in
the
pure
gluon
sector
is
specified
by
the
nonperturbative
effective
potential
for
the
Polyakov
loop
obtained
recently
by
Braun,
Gies,
Marhauser
and
Pawlowski.
The
basic
ingredients
are
a
reformulation
of
QCD
based
on
new
variables
and
the
flow
equation
of
the
Wetterich
type
in
the
Wilsonian
renormalization
group.
This
framework
can
be
applied
to
investigate
the
QCD
phase
diagram
at
finite
temperature
and
density.
