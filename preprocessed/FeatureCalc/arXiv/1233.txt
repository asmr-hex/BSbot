of
Topologically

gauge
theory
with
fermion
\\
Using
Bloch-Nordsieck
approximation
fermion
propagator
in
3-dimensional
gauge
theory
with
topological
mass
is
studied.
Infrared
divergence
of
Chern-Simon
term
is
soft,which
modifies
anomalous
dimension.
In
unquenched
QCD
with
2-component
spinor
anomalous
dimension
has
fractional
value,where
order
parmeter
is
divergent.
