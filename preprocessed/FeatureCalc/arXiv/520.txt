Numerical
evaluation
of
spherical
GJMS
determinants
for
even
dimensions
\\
The
functional
determinants
of
the
GJMS
scalar
operators,
P_{2k},
on
even-dimensional
spheres
are
computed
via
Barnes
multiple
gamma
functions
relying
on
the
numerical
availability
of
the
digamma
function.
For
the
critical
k=d/2
case,
it
is
necessary
to
calculate
the
Stirling
moduli.
The
multiplicative
anomalies
are
given
as
odd
polynomials
in
$k$
and
it
is
emphasised
that
that
the
Dirichlet--to--Robin
factorisation,
P_{2l+1},
gives
the
same
results
as
P_{2k}
if
k=l+1/2.The
results
are
presented
as
graphs
and
show
a
series
of
extrema
in
the
effective
action
as
k
is
varied
in
the
reals.
For
odd
dimensions
these
extrema
occur
at
integer
k.
