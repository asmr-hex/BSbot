demystifying
bubble
nucleation
at
the
LHC
\\
recently,
work
on
technicolor
has
opened
up
a
planar
class
of
left-right
models.
using
the
behavior
of
general
duality,
we
classify
the
extension
of
type
IIB
strings
near
a
small
black
hole.
equations
of
adjoint
TQFTs
deformed
by
surface
operators
are
also
examined.
after
surveying
bubble
nucleation
at
SNO,
we
check
that
a
solution
of
a
adjoint
QFT

is
linear.
