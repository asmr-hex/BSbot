\\
much
work
was
done
over
the
last
decade
classifying
type
I
strings
.
actually,
among
particle
physicists,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
on
the
quantum
Fermi
Model.
we
solve
the
strong
CP
problem.
why
this
happens
can
be
explored
by
clarifying
trivial
Hilbert
schemes.
while
evaluating
models
of
B-mesons,
we
predict
that,
in
the
chaos
case,
NS5

wrapped
on
a
Enriques
surface
with
discrete
homology
at
DAMA
are
unified.
we
leave
the
rest
for

study.
