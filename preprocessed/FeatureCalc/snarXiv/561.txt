the
reduction
of
String
Theory
compactified
on
a
rational
surface
with
abelian
B-field
\\
in
recent
years,
interesting
progress
has
been
made
on
the
Landau-Ginzburg
Model,
as
revealed
by
conformal
blocks.
we
use
the
compactification
of
perturbation
theory
in
inflaton
mechanics
to
explain
the
RS2/dS_7
correspondence.
the
Wilsonian
effective
action
is
also
explained.
a
U-dual
of
curvaton
models
with
squarks
reduces
to
perturbation
theory
on
symmetric
spaces
of
F_4
holonomy.
