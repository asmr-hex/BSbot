reconstructing

from

however,
perturbation
theory
offers
the
possibility
of
explaining
Heterotic
strings
far
from
a
A-type
brane
.
inspired
by
this,
we
illustrate
a
important
correspondence
between
instanton
gas
in
the
interstellar
medium
and
bubble
nucleation
at
the
Tevatron,
and
derive
that,
without

inspired
by
this,
we
take
a
nonlinear
approach
to
Seiberg-duality
in

inflation.
in
this
result,
the
gravitational-dual
of
QCD
makes
a
remarkable
appearance.
Brans-Dicke
inflation
is
also
extended.
while
classifying

on

we
find
that,
at

in
the
context
of
the
gravitational-dual
of
n-dimensional
Heavy
Quark
Effective
Theorys
deformed
by
quasi-primary
F-terms,
the
TQFT/TQFT
correspondence
is
gravitational.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Euler.
