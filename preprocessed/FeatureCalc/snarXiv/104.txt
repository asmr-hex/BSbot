why
axions
are
warped
\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
RS2
has
opened
up
a
unstable
class
of
RS
models.
thus,
B-meson
production
(excluding
linear
models
with
hadrons)
is
usually
found
via
inconsistent
fluctuations
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
we
show
that
quantum
hierarchies
in
supersymmetric
QED
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
can
be
realized
from
the
entropic
solution
to
the
SUSY
CP
problem.
the
determination
of
the
partition
function
localizes
to
n
copies
of
R^8.
clarifying
N=4
TQFTs
on
warped
rational
surfaces
is
related
to
localization
in
supergravity
far
from
du
Val
singularities.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
evaluating
the
effective
potential.
