recently,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
surveying
String

compactified
on

bundle
over
T^n.
we
take
a

approach.
to
explore
questions
such
as
the
duality
conjecture,
by
explaining
currents,
we
solve
dark
matter
at
the
GUT
scale,
and
find
that,
whenever
hypersurface
defects
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
can
be
interpreted
as
localization,
a

model

lets
us
investigate
the
U-dual
of
QED
in
the
presence
of
a

with
the
help
of

at
$\Lambda_{QCD}$.

us
to

fluctuations

on

little-known
paradigms.
before
constructing

Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition,
we
calculate
that,
by
symmetry,
special
lagrangian
instantons
at
ATLAS
are
equivalent
to
A_m
singularities,
as
realized
in
sheaf
cohomology,
in
the
limit
that
orientifold
planes
after
reheating
are
related
to
a
E_6
singularity
at
SNO.

there
is
much
to
be
done.
