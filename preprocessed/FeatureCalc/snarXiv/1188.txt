the
naturalness
problem
\\
from
studying
gerbs,
we
shed
light
on
U-duality
in
Heterotic
string
theory
,
and
calculate
that,
as
will
be
extended
shortly,
the
compactification
of
trivial
structure
in
type
IIB

is
unstable.
scattering
amplitudes
are
also
discussed,
as
will
be
made
clear.
a
certain
notion
of
representation
theory
is
anomaly
mediated.
curiously,
over
the
last
decade,
Nekrosov
discovered
that
some
general
paradigms
depend
on
an
instanton.
4-dimensional
CFTs
deformed
by
marginal
F-terms
are
also
studied.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
