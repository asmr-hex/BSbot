deriving
Kachru's
equation:
a
certain
notion
of
localization
\\
gravitational-duality
in
Heterotic
strings

gives
a
mysterious
framework
for
solving
the
analytic
continuation
of
Topological
String
Theory
on
R^m
x
R^n.
using
the
behavior
of
the
analytic
continuation
of
representation
theory
in
String
theories
,
we
solve
extending

I
strings
deformed
by
local
F-terms.
a
holographic
superconductor
is
also
explored.
our
results
demonstrate
that
the
three-fluid
formalism
is
nilpotent.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
complicated
edifice.
