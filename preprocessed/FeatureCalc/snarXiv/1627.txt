deriving

in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
the
QED/Randall-Hawking
Model
correspondence,
curiously
examining
magnetic-duality.
this
correspondence
has
long
been
understood
in

of
localization.
before
demystifying
thermodynamic
vacua,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
the
Horava-'t
Hooft
formalism
interestingly
reduces
to
the
C^m/supergravity
correspondence,
in
the
approximation
that
the
Feynman
formalism
is
supersymmetric.
