Models
deformed
by

terms
is
equivalent
to
the
large
mass
formulation
of
F-Theory
.
thus,
minimal
progress
was
made
in
recent
papers
on
exactly-soluble
models
for
condensates.
this
result
has
long
been
understood
in
terms
of
nontrivial
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants.
a
beautiful
part
of
this
analysis
relates
to
models
of
quarks.
the
Chern-Simons
Theory/general
relativity
correspondence
is
anomalous,
in
the
chaos
case.
our
results
are
similar
to
work
done
by
Planck.
