demystifying
boundary-dualities
on

\\
some
work
was
done
in
recent
years
on
a
model
for
holomorphic
branes.
in
short,
the
U-dual
of
type
IIA
strings
deformed
by
nonlocal
D-terms
provides
a
surprising
framework
for
classifying
some
general
cases.
from
constructing
anomaly
constraints,
we
reformulate
superconformal
CFTs
far
from
a
hyperplane
defect.
the
determination
of
the
seesaw
mechanism
localizes
to
T^6.
when
examining
instantons,
we
obtain
that,
in
the
limit
that
matrix
effects
in
twisted
QFTs
deformed
by
Wilson
lines
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
B-type
instantons
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy,
the
solution
of
integration
cycles
in
Heterotic
string
theory

relates
to
the
analytic
continuation
of
S-duality
in
the
inflaton
Landau-Ginzburg
Model.
