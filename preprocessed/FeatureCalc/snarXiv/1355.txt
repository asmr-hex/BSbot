multidimensional
models
of
dark
energy
\\
in
recent
papers,
some
work
has
been
done
on
general
relativity
in
order
to
verify
that
some
general
frameworks
are
planar.
we
solve
the
cosmological
constant
problem.
halo
models
for
large-N
fluctuations
are
also
explained.
discussing
modified
models
for
cosmic
rays
is
equivalent
to
instanton
gas
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
consequently,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
