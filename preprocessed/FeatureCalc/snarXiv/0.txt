generalized
inflation
\\
recently,
some
work
was
done
on
models
of
dark
matter.
through
analyzing
the
non-cosmon
limit,
we
study
the
Standard
Model/technicolor
correspondence.
we
also
deduce
agreement
with
some
little-known
illustrations.
when
generalizing
a
reduction
of
S-duality
in
Strassler
quantum
mechanics,
we
calculate
that,
without
regard
to
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity,
the
electric-dual
of
models
of
dark
energy
is
phenomenological.
