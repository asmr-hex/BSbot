exploring
Hilbert
schemes
in
unparticle
physics
with
a
translation
symmetric
deformation
on
a
G_2
orbifold
of
a
linear
dilaton
background
\\
we
confirm
that
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
the
XXZ
Model
is
equivalent
to
the
U(1)
problem,
and
find
that,
as
will
be
discussed
shortly,
the
compactification
of
models
of
instanton
liquids
is
non-gaussian.
next,
using
the
behavior
of
the
U(1)
problem,
we
analyze
anomalous
dimensions.
some
specific
frameworks
are
unified.
in
short,
much
work
was
done
in
recent
years
on
non-gaussian
gauge
mediation.
analyzing
is
made
easier
by
solving
orientifold
planes.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
reformulating
the
Chern-Simons
Theory/T^m
correspondence.
