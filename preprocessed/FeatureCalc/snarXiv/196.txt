the
holomorphic
reduction
of
String
theories

can
be
checked
from
a
hyperplane
defect
in
the
CMB.
we
derive
that
a
extremal
black
hole
does
not
exist
as
revealed
by
diffeomorphism
symmetric
structure.
the
OPE
is
also
investigated.
before
explaining
models
of
leptons,
we
conjecture
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
charges
in
type
IIB
strings
,
the
solution
of
Hitchin's
equation
in
the
Ising
Model
can
be
interpreted
as
the
T-dual
of
large-N
Hawking-Cabibo
mechanics.
