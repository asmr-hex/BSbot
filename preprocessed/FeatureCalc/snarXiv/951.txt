fractional
D3
branes
at
the
weak
scale
\\
trivial
Gromov-Witten
invariants
are
5-dimensional.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
condensates,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
a
n-dimensional
solution
to
the
naturalness
problem
by
divisors
on
T^m.
the
computation
of
"a
holographic
superconductor"
localizes
to
CY_n.
when
analyzing
models
of
(p,q)
branes,
we
obtain
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Gubser,
some
specific
computations
can
be
incorporated
into
condensates
at
ATLAS.
