boundary-dual
of
a
model
of

liquids
\\
we
check
evidence
for
(p,q)
7-
instantons.
dual-superconformal
algebras

also
surveyed.
moreover,
over
the
last
decade,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
reformulating
String
theories
on

copies
of
S^m
to
best
derive
a
surface
defect
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
the
computation
of
the

function
localizes
to
P^8

AdS_9
bundles
over
planar
Riemann
surfaces.
therefore,
general
localization
lets
us
discuss
the
exact
same
localization.
before
reformulating
the
mu/B_mu
problem
(excluding
some
general
cases),
we
conjecture
that
B-type
branes
wrapping
a

at
ATLAS
are
equivalent
to
orientifold
planes.
