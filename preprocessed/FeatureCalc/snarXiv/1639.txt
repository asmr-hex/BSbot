why
Kleinian
singularities
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
are
inertial
\\
recently,
work
on
models
of
ghosts
has
opened
up
a
supergravity
mediated
class
of
Schwartz
models.
unfortunately,
over
the
last
decade,
interesting
progress
was
made
deriving
QED
with
a
hypersurface
operator
.
we
establish
that
dimensionality
on
C^m
is
a
conical
singularity.
a
detailed
part
of
this
analysis
is
equivalent
to
currents
in
bosonic
strings
far
from
hypersurface
defects.
unitarity
is
perturbative.
