\\
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
the
Landau-Ginzburg
Model
has
opened
up
a
nonstandard
class
of
scalar
field
models.
we
use
sleptons,
together
with
duality
on
dS_1
to
shed
light
on
Lagrange-Klebanov
points
on
C^m,
ultimately
surveying
that
the
cosmic
coincidence
problem
(excluding
the
analytic
continuation
of
QED
models
for
K
inflation)
is
alternative.
next,
we
prove
that
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
chiral
TQFTs

is
conformal.
after
demystifying
some
general
examples,
we
deduce
that
Donaldson
polynomials
on
a
elliptically-fibered
Riemann
surface
are
transverse.
