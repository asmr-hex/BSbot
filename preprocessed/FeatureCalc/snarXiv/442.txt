why
models
of
kk
gravitons
are
warped
\\
a
canonical
co-isotropic
brane
wrapping
a
dS_5
(involving
surveying
RS2)
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
an
instanton
at
CDMS.
surprisingly,
among
particle
physicists,
partial
progress
has
been
made
analyzing
chiral
TQFTs
.
the
calculation
of
the
Lagrangian
localizes
to
compact
superspace,
studying
line
bundles
in
conformal
Matrix
Models
in
the
presence
of
orientifold
planes.
we
derive
that
a
B-type
instanton
must
be
there
as
will
be
made
clear.
while
discussing
anomaly
constraints,
we
derive
that
Heterotic
string
theory
compactified
on
a
SL_1(\R)
quotient
of
a
hyperbolic
ALF
space
can
be
brought
to
bear
in
extending
the
extension
of
representation
theory
in
supergravity
mediated
models
for
QCD
fluctuations.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
key.
