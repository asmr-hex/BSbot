quite
simply,
little
work
was
done
in
recent
years
on
models
of
monopoles.
motivated
by
this,
we
use
a
nonstandard
reduction
of
models
of
quintessence
(excluding
the
formulation
of
RS1)
to
derive
a
certain
notion
of
T-duality.
a
charming
part
of
this
analysis
follows
from
charginos,
exploring
some
particular
examples.
when
extending
the
possible
extension

String
Theory
,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
reconstructed
shortly,
a

is
related
to
String
Theory
