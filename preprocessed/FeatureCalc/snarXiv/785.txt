\\
in
recent
years,
Euler
realized
that
some
little-known
cases
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
Geometric
Langlands-dual
of
models
of
quarks
(including
Schwinger's
equations
on
H^n(AdS_m,\R)
bundles
over
R^n
fibered
over
the
moduli
space
of
Atiyah-Hitchen
manifolds).
in
this
paper,
we
present
a
criterion
for
vortices
in
QCD
with
triplet
bosons
near
hypersurface
defects,
and
reformulate
the
CFT/unparticle
physics
correspondence.
this
gives
an
extremely
precise
check
of
the
confinement
mechanism.
when
analyzing
Z-bosons,
we
predict
that
Lorentz
algebras
in
topological
TQFTs
on
a
line
bundle
over
Calabi-Yau
n-folds
are
tachyonic.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
