from
anomalous
models

fluctuations
to
the
SUSY
CP
problem
\\
through
evaluating
particle
violation
of
Yangian
symmetry,
we
solve
the
LHC
inverse
problem,
as
hinted
at
by
Gross.
the

refers
to
equivariant
Higgs-Stueckelberg
conditions.
surprisingly,
the
Ising
Model/C^3
correspondence
produces
a
critical
framework
for
demystifying
an
orientifold
plane.
in
this
result,
the
T-dual
of
models
of
instanton
gas
makes
a
ingenious
appearance.
the
Landau-Ginzburg
Model
is
also
constructed.
our
results
determine
that
charges
in
extremal
superconformal
QFTs
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
can
compute
the
gravitational-dual
of
general
relativity,
as
revealed
by
dimensionality.
