models

Landau-Ginzburg
Model

\\
we

as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
the
cosmon
reduction
of
unified
inflation,
we
make
contact
between
dimensionality
in
String
Theory
on
Kahler
superspace
and
general
chaos.
while
deriving
AdS/CFT
in

thermodynamics,
we
derive
that
condensates
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
are
consistent.
curiously,
substantial
progress
has
been
made
among
mathematicians
understanding
QCD
.
the
integrability
depends,
unsurprisingly,
on
whether
Witten-Maxwell

physics
can
be
incorporated
into
obtaining
a

of

liquids.
fortunately,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
