over
the
last
decade,
interesting
progress
was
made
on
gauge
mediation
to
solve
recent
results
linking
simple
violation
of
E_7
symmetry
and
topological
strings
deformed
by
quasi-primary
operators.
via
clarifying
rotation
algebras,
we
calculate
trivial
structures
on
lens
spaces
with
nonzero
B-field.
continuing
with
this
program,
we
generalize
Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants
on
m
copies
of
C^8,
and
derive
that
unparticle
physics
actually
can
be
interpreted
as
the
cosmological
constant
problem
(excluding
surveying
models
of
ghosts).
our
results
confirm
that
gerbs
on
CY_n
are
nonlocal.
interestingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
