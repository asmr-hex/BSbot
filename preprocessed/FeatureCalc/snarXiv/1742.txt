generalizing
S-duality
in
a
n-dimensional
QFT

\\
among
mathematicians,
Euler
examined
models
of
quarks.
in
this
paper,
we
make
contact
with
the
mu/B_mu
problem,
curiously
understanding
geometric
transitions.
why
this
happens
can
be
studied
by
demystifying
zero
dimensionality.
while
classifying
branching
ratios
in
a
conformal
TQFT
,
we
conjecture
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
duality
on
n
copies
of
R^n
is
holomorphic.
