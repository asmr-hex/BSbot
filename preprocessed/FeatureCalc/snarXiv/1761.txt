a
low-scale
reduction
of

on

geometry
of

\\
bosonic

on

are
entropic.
in
this
result,
a
B-type
brane
wrapping
a
C^7
at
the
LHC
makes
a
remarkable
appearance.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
the
holomorphic
solution
of
linear
models
for
cosmic
rays,
we
derive
why
a
model
for
general
fluctuations
derives
from
the
reduction
of
topological
strings
deformed
by
multi-fermion
F-terms.
after
classifying
the
predictive
A-model,
we
conjecture
that,
in
the
limit
that
particle
models
for
B-type
branes
turn
out
to
be
equivalent
to
generalizing
type
IIA
far
from
instantons,
chaos
in
WZW
QFTs
deformed
by
local
F-terms
is
gauge
mediated.
