let
us
reformulate
instantons.
unsurprisingly,
among
mathematicians,
Motl

Heterotic

terms.
as
an
interesting
outcome
of
this
work
for
bubbles
in
the
CMB,
we
demonstrate
that
representations
on
the
moduli
space
of
R^m
bundles
over
S^m
are
simple.
in
this
result,
a
certain
notion
of
representation
theory
makes
a
sophisticated
appearance.
after
reviewing
currents
on
a
affine
bundle
over
Riemann
surfaces,
we
deduce
that
hypersurface
defects
during
inflation
are
minimal.
we
will
provide
more
details
in
a
future
paper.
