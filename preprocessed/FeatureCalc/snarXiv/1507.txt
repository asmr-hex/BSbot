conjectured

we
will

in

curiously,
a

notion
of

(taking
into

F-Theory

gives
rise
to
a
extraordinary
framework
for
reviewing

we

universe,
together
with
cosmic
rays
at
the
edge
of

universe
to
formulate
decay

as
revealed
by
boundary-dualities.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
illustrate
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
the
extension
of
charges
in
a
model
for
instanton

and
A_m
singularities
at
the
edge
of
our
universe.
after
deriving
anomaly
matching,
we
find
that,
whenever
large
black
holes
are
exclusive,
Gromov-Witten
invariants
in
supersymmetric
CFTs
surrounded
by
surface
defects
are
minimal.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
perplexing
law.
