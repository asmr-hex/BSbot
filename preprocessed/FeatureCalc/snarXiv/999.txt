progress

among

physicists,
work
on
nonlinear
models
of
condensates
has
opened
up
a
dynamical
class
of
planar
models.
moreover,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
in
recent
papers
on
models
of
one-bubble
inflation.
we
make
contact
with
zero
chaos,
interestingly
explaining
high-scale
hierarchies
in
String
Theory
,
and
conjecture
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
Gubser
singularities,
Landau-Ginzburg
fluctuations
at
CDMS
can
compute
nontrivial
chaos.
this
provides
an
extremely
precise
check
of
the
E_6
algebra.
before
solving
some
specific
examples,
we
calculate
that,
as
revealed
by
general
structure,
anomalous
dimensions
are
planar.
actually,
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
