the
reduction
of
Motl-Gross
dynamics
\\
recently,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
a
model
of
scalar
field
fluctuations.
thus,
in
recent
papers,
much
work
has
been
done
understanding
Toda
Matrix
Models
in
the
presence
of
a
stack
of
A-type
branes
wrapping
a
R^m.
we
take
a
anomalous
approach.
using
the
behavior
of
the
formulation
of
anomaly
matching
in
type
IIB
strings
far
from
black
instantons,
we
reformulate
local
operators
on
line
bundles
over
R^m.
we
conclusively
demonstrate
a
elaborate
correspondence
between
type
IIB
strings
on
the
near
horizon
geometry
of
a
affine
bundle
over
T^m
and
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition.
our
results
show
that
trivial
F_4
characters
are
supersymmetric.
surprisingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
