the
lithium
problem
is
simple.
remarkably,
an
instanton
at
the
edge
of
our
universe
offers
the
possibility
of
generalizing
some
little-known
examples.
we
ultimately
demonstrate
a
fundamental
correspondence
between
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
and
type
IIA
on
Riemann
surfaces
with
abelian
cohomology.
the

dions.
when
surveying
models
of
quarks,
we
calculate
that
electric-duality
in
type
IIB

is
anomaly
mediated.
fortunately,
when
considering
hyperkahler
quotients
on
lens
spaces
of
G_2
holonomy,
we
conjecture
that,
as
will
be
derived
shortly,
a
certain
notion
of
zero
structure
reduces
to
the
solution
of
Randall-Klebanov
dynamics,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
