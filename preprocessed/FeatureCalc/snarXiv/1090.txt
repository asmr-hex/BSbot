the
Thirring
Model/T^m
correspondence
\\
we
make
contact
between
effective
unparticle
physics
and
representations
in
type
IIA
,
by
symmetry,
as
will
be
made
clear.
a
certain
notion
of
sheaf
cohomology
led
to
a
beautiful
rule:
type
IIB
strings
compactified
on
E_7
quotients
of
3
copies
of
R^3
can
be
realized
from
clarifying
unconventional
models
.
surprisingly,
in
recent
papers,
much
work
has
been
done
on
Lifschitz-Seiberg
unparticle
physics
to
prove
that
Seiberg-dualities
in
WZW
TQFTs
on
affine
bundles
over
P^7
are
extra-ordinary.
fragmentation
functions
are
also
recalled,
bounding
a
boundary-dual
of
a
G_2
model
.
the
flavor
Hilbert
space
is
also
explained.
general
currents
are
tachyonic.
