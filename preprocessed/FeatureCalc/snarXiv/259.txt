among
mathematicians,
little
work
has
been
done
on
models
of
instanton
liquids
in
a
way
that
gives
rise
to
the
R^m/C^9
correspondence
(including
a
surface
defect
on
the
surface
of
the
sun).
in
short,
little
work
has
been
done
in
recent
papers

deformed
by
quasi-primary

to
reformulate
the
supergravity/A-model
correspondence.
non-nonlocal
models
with
B-mesons
are

generalized.
our

are
multidimensional,
in

that

can
be
derived
from
the
confinement
problem.
