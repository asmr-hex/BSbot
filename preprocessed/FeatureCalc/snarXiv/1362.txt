over
the
last
decade,
much
work
has
been
done
on
Planck
technicolor.
therefore,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
among
mathematicians
reviewing
topologically
twisted
QFTs
on
Klebanov-Strassler
backgrounds
of
SU(m)
holonomy.
we
solve
the
mu/B_mu
problem.
regularization
is
also
studied.
after
deriving
cosmic
rays
in
our
solar
system,
we
find
that,
by
translation
symmetry,
the
Standard
Model
is
impossible.
in
short,
while
considering
the
O(n)
Model/MSSM
correspondence,
we
derive
that
equivariant

in

topologically

Matrix
Models
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
can
be
interpreted
as
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in

deformed
by
BPS
F-terms.
therefore,
holomorphic

us
clarify

terms.
interestingly,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
