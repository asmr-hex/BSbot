that

particular
frameworks
are
tachyonic.

contact

QFTs

(involving

depends
on
a
solution
to
the
mu/B_mu
problem
through
IR
behavior,

we've
been
unable

when
investigating
dimensionality,
we
discover
that,
as
we

in

Gaiotto-Denef's

is
anthropic.
given
this,
our
work
may
seem
quite
perplexing.
