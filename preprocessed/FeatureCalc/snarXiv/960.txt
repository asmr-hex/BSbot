\\
some

in
short,
in
recent
papers,
a
fair
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
a
model
for
NS5
branes
in
order
to
avoid
extending
a
certain
notion
of
Nekrosov-Lagrange's
equation.
models
of
holomorphic
branes
are
also
reconstructed.
technicolor
is
also
examined.
IR
behavior
is
calculable.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
analyzing
the
lithium
problem.
