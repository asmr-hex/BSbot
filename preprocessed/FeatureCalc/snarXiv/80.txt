why
instanton
liquids
in
our
solar
system
are
warped
\\
we
make
contact
between
the
Landau-Ginzburg
extension
of
a
nilpotent
model
with
hadrons
and
chaos
in
topological
strings
.
N=6
Matrix
Models

are
exclusive
supposing
that
the
mu
problem
is
holomorphic.
after
analyzing
models
of
spacetime
foam,
we
deduce
that
a
certain
notion
of
unitarity
is
alternative.
surprisingly,
over
the
last
decade,
minimal
progress
was
made
on
models
of
bubble
nucleation,
whenever
PDFs
are
momentum-dependent.
we
take
a
quantum
gravitational
approach.
why
this
happens
can
be
generalized
by
clarifying
representation
theory
in
F-Theory
.
we
believe
this
is
indicative
of
a
simple
principle.
