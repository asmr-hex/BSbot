reformulating
nontrivial
representation
theory
\\
over
the
last
decade,
partial
progress
has
been
made
evaluating
M-Theory
on
a
rational
surface.
we
calculate
evidence
for
holomorphic
instantons.
we
also
deduce
agreement
with
equivariant
hyperkahler
quotients.
when
reformulating
solitons,
we
discover
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Susskind,
nonzero
central
charges
are
related
to
chiral
QED
.
