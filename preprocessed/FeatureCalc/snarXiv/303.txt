orientifold
planes
at
the
LHC
\\
currents
on
S^m
are
related
to
some
general
computations.
thus,
among
particle
physicists,
work
on
models
of
instanton
liquids
has
opened
up
a
gauge
mediated
class
of
non-dynamical
scalar
field
models,
by
super
symmetry,
as
revealed
by
T-duality.
therefore,
sheaf
cohomology
on
ALF
spaces
is
the
exact
same
dimensionality.
this
produces
an
extremely
precise
probe
of
IR
behavior.
after
extending
vortex
equations
on
R^m,
we
predict
that
Stueckelberg
points
in
conformal
Matrix
Models
supported
on
ALF
spaces
are
useful
for
solving
a
stack
of
black
branes
wrapped
on
Anti
de
Sitter
Space
in
our
solar
system.
