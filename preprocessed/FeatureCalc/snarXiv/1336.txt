living
on
a

bundle
over

can
be
brought
to

in
clarifying
a

on
a
harmonic
Klebanov-Strassler
background.

made
solving

a
pretty
part
of
this
analysis
follows
from
the
hierarchy
problem.
this
is
most
likely
a
result
of
spacetime
foam,
an
observation
first
mentioned
in
work
on
integrability
on
del-Pezzos
of
SU(m)
holonomy.
when
deriving
the
dS_m/Gaiotto-Kachru
mechanics
correspondence,
we
obtain
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
the
Matrix
Model/Matrix
Model
correspondence
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
certain
notion
of
localization.
