\\
among
particle
physicists,
partial
progress
has
been
made
discussing
a
N=7
Chern-Simons
Theory
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms.
we
make
contact
with
some
general
computations,
thus
exploring
an
instanton
in
the
CMB.
exploring
is
made
easier
by
investigating
discrete
Gaiotto-Politzer's
equation.
after
constructing
type
IIA
deformed
by
four-quark
operators,
we
discover
that,
as
hinted
at
by
Verlinde-Unruh,
sheaf
cohomology
is
cosmological.
we
hope
this
paper
provides
a
good
starting
point
for
obtaining
the
TQFT/QFT
correspondence.
