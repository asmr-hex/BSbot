unfortunately,
among
mathematicians,
Planck
calculated
that
perturbation
theory
on
a
line
bundle
over
T^m
x
P^8

T^6
is
conformal.
why
this
happens
can
be
constructed
by
generalizing
a
resolution
of
the
flavor
problem.
the
conformal

is
also
surveyed.

equivalent
to
surveying

therefore,
there
is
much
to
be
done.
