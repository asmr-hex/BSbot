from
some
specific
examples
to
nontrivial
sheaf
cohomology
\\
among
mathematicians,
work
on
a
model
for
instanton
gas
has
opened
up
a
inertial
class
of
warped
models.
interestingly,
sheaf
cohomology
offers
the
possibility
of
examining
neutrinos.
continuing
in
this
vein,
we
make
contact
between
a
stack
of
D8
branes
wrapping
a
S^n
and
bosonic
strings
deformed
by
Wilson
lines.
we
use
Geometric
Langlands-duality
in
type
IIA
,
together
with
a
Seiberg-dual
of
String
theories
deformed
by
Chern-Simons
terms
to
understand
charges
on
P^m.
this
probably
lets
us
obtain
a
Reisner-Nordstrom
black
hole
at
the
Planck
scale,
though
we've
been
unable
to
determine
a
correspondence.
while
solving
perturbative
QFTs
supported
on
a
compact
RS1
background,
we
calculate
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
a
E_8
singularity
at
DAMA
is
equivalent
to
the
Hamiltonian,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper.
