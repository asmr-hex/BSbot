reformulating
the
supergravity/gauge
mediation
correspondence
\\
integration
cycles
in
deformed
QCD
far
from
D3
instantons
can
be
interpreted
as
a
predictive
solution
of
Heterotic
strings
.
the
calculation
of
matrix
violation
of
diffeomorphism
invariance
localizes
to
a
harmonic
Riemann
surface.
we
calculate
that
an
orientifold
plane
is
present
as
will
be
examined
shortly.
after
exploring
Donaldson
polynomials
on
CY_m,
we
obtain
that,
as
we
will
see
in
this
paper,
models
of
entanglement
entropy
are
D-term
inflationary,
without
regard
to
models
of
B-mesons.
