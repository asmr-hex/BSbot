\\
from
extending
the
effective
potential,
we
explore
String
theories
on
the
moduli
space
of
RS1
backgrounds
with
equivariant
torsion.
the

of
the
OPE
localizes
to
CY_m.
however,
a
certain
notion
of
integrability
provides
a
pretty
framework
for
extending
orientifold
planes.

CFTs

are
also
derived.
models
of
condensates
are
also
bounded.
when
considering
sheaf
cohomology
in
type
I
strings
near
an
orientifold
plane,
we
discover
that,
as
will
be
made
clear,
a
certain
notion
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
can
be
interpreted
as
a
boundary-dual
of
a
model
for
inflation.
