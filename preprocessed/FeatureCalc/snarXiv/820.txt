in

work
on
the

has
opened
up
a
chiral

of

models,
with
the
help
of
Seiberg's
equations
on

by

as
an

of
this
work
for

to
explore
questions
such

the

we
present
a
criterion
for

and
check
that

is
equivalent
to

quotients
of

over

(involving
the
QED/NNMSSM
correspondence),
as
will
be
extended
shortly.

interestingly,
