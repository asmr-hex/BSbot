investigated.
our

that
anomalous

CFTs
surrounded
by
a
stack
of
B-type
branes
wrapped
on

are
related
to

surprisingly,
recently,
little
work
has
been
done
on
a
model
of
canonical
co-isotropic
branes
to
show
that
electric-dualities
on
T^m
are
inconsistent.
we
take
a
minimal
approach.
a
elaborate
part
of
this
analysis
is
equivalent
to
D4

wrapped
on
a
ALE
fibration
with
zero
dimension.
we
will
provide
more
details
in

paper.
