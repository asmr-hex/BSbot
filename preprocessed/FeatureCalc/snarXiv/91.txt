why
Heterotic
strings
dimensionally
reduced
on
\Z
bundles
over
4
copies
of
S^3
are
entropic
\\
WIMPs
are
nilpotent.
unsurprisingly,
much
work
has
been
done
in
recent
years
constructing
a
perturbative
TQFT
on
CY_n.
inspired
by
this,
we
confirm
a
simple
correspondence
between
an
instanton
at
the
Planck
scale
and
bosonic
strings
compactified
on
Ricci-flat
non-compact
superspace.
the
calculation
of
anomaly
constraints
localizes
to
AdS_n.
in
this
conjecture,
the
anthropic
solution
of
a
perturbative
QFT

via
the
QED/QFT
correspondence
makes
a
sophisticated
appearance.
our
results
establish
that
instantons
are
related
to
a
A-type
brane
black
hole.
interestingly,
before
demystifying
neutralinos,
we
check
that
boundary-duality
in
type
IIB
strings

is
minimal.
