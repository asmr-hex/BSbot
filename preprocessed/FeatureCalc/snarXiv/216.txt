discussing
String
theories
surrounded
by
holomorphic
instantons:
a
primordial
approach
\\
in
recent
years,
much
work
has
been
done
on
a
unparticle
model
.
however,
in
recent
years,
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
generalizing
String
Theory
compactified
on
a
lens
space
of
\Z
holonomy
to
illustrate
that
gluons
can
compute
U-duality
in
8-dimensional
Matrix
Models
living
on
dS_m.
in
this
paper,
we
confirm
that
models
of
inflation
can
be
obtained
from
gerbs
on
a
lens
space
of
H_n(AdS_8,\R)
holonomy.
the
partition
function
is
also
demystified.
our
results
illustrate
that
gluons
are
supergravity
mediated,
as
realized
in
a
analytic
continuation
of
Clebsch-Gordon
decomposition
in
type
I
strings
deformed
by
marginal
operators.
