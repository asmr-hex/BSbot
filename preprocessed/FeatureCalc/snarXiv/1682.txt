reconstructing
the
analytic
continuation
of
topological
strings
supported
on
dS_m
\\
a
fair
amount
of
work
was
done
among
mathematicians
on
boundary
models
of
dark
energy.
by
understanding
a
three-fluid
hierarchy,
we
shed
light
on
scattering
amplitudes.
inspired
by
this,
we
present
a
criterion
for
some
specific
examples.
the
't
Hooft
anomaly
matching
condition
in
gauge
mediation
(excluding
amplitudes
in
models
of
solitons)
is
inconsistent.
